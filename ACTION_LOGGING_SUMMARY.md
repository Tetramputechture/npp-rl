# Action Logging Improvements - Summary

## 🎯 What Was Done

Significantly improved the action logging in TensorBoard to make agent behavior analysis **much clearer and more informative**.

## 📊 Key Improvements

### 1. Descriptive Action Names

**Before**: `actions/frequency_action_0`, `actions/frequency_action_1`, ...
**After**: `actions/frequency/NOOP`, `actions/frequency/Left`, `actions/frequency/Jump+Left`, ...

Now you immediately understand which gameplay movements correspond to which metrics!

### 2. Movement Analysis (NEW)

Added `actions/movement/` metrics:
- **stationary_pct**: Time spent idle
- **active_pct**: Time spent moving
- **left_bias**: Directional preference
- **right_bias**: Directional preference

**Why useful**: Quickly see if agent is too passive, or has directional bias

### 3. Jump Analysis (NEW)

Added `actions/jump/` metrics:
- **frequency**: How often agent jumps
- **directional_pct**: How often jumps include horizontal movement (good!)
- **vertical_only_pct**: How often agent just jumps up (less efficient)

**Why useful**: Track if agent learns efficient jumping patterns over time

### 4. Action Transitions (NEW)

Added `actions/transitions/` metrics like:
- `Left_to_Jump+Left`: Probability of jumping left after moving left
- `Right_to_Right`: Probability of continuing right movement
- `NOOP_to_Jump`: Probability of jumping from standstill

**Why useful**: Understand action sequences and planning behavior

## 📈 N++ Action Space Reference

| Action | Name | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 0 | NOOP | Stand still |
| 1 | Left | Move left |
| 2 | Right | Move right |
| 3 | Jump | Jump in place |
| 4 | Jump+Left | Jump and move left |
| 5 | Jump+Right | Jump and move right |

## 🔍 What You Can Now Analyze

### Detect Training Issues

**Too Passive:**
```
stationary_pct: 0.60  ← Agent spending 60% time idle (problem!)
active_pct: 0.40
```

**Jump Spam:**
```
jump/frequency: 0.75           ← Jumping 75% of time (excessive!)
jump/directional_pct: 0.35     ← Only 35% include movement (inefficient!)
```

**Oscillation:**
```
transitions/Left_to_Right: 0.40   ← Switching directions often (indecisive)
transitions/Right_to_Left: 0.38
```

### Track Learning Progress

**Early Training** (agent hasn't learned much):
```
stationary_pct: 0.45           ← Very passive
directional_pct: 0.40          ← Random jumping
Left_to_Right: 0.25            ← No clear patterns
```

**Late Training** (agent learned effective behavior):
```
stationary_pct: 0.10           ← More active!
directional_pct: 0.88          ← Learned directional jumps!
Left_to_Jump+Left: 0.72        ← Coherent sequences!
```

### Compare Architectures

See which architecture learns better movement patterns:

| Metric | Architecture A | Architecture B |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| active_pct | 0.75 | 0.65 |
| directional_pct | 0.82 | 0.68 |
| stationary_pct | 0.25 | 0.35 |

**Conclusion**: Architecture A learns more active, efficient behavior

## 📚 TensorBoard Organization

All metrics organized in clear hierarchy:

```
actions/
├── entropy                       (Overall diversity)
├── frequency/                    (How often each action used)
│   ├── NOOP
│   ├── Left
│   ├── Right
│   ├── Jump
│   ├── Jump+Left
│   └── Jump+Right
├── movement/                     (Movement patterns)
│   ├── stationary_pct
│   ├── active_pct
│   ├── left_bias
│   └── right_bias
├── jump/                         (Jump patterns)
│   ├── frequency
│   ├── directional_pct
│   └── vertical_only_pct
└── transitions/                  (Action sequences)
    ├── NOOP_to_Jump
    ├── Left_to_Jump+Left
    ├── Right_to_Jump+Right
    └── ... (all significant transitions)
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### No Code Changes Needed!

Just train as usual:
```bash
python scripts/train_and_compare.py \
    --experiment-name "my_experiment" \
    --architectures vision_free \
    --train-dataset ../nclone/datasets/train \
    --test-dataset ../nclone/datasets/test \
    --total-timesteps 1000000 \
    --num-envs 16
```

### View in TensorBoard

```bash
tensorboard --logdir experiments/

# Open browser to http://localhost:6006
# Navigate to Scalars tab
# Look for 'actions/' metrics
```
