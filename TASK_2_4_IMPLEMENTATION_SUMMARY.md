## 🔬 Technical Details

### Hierarchical Hyperparameters

**High-Level Policy** (Subtask Selection):
```python
- Learning rate: 1e-4 → 1e-5 (linear decay)
- Batch size: 64
- Update frequency: Every 50 steps
- Network: [128, 128]
- Clip range: 0.1 (conservative)
- Entropy coef: 0.01
```

**Low-Level Policy** (Action Execution):
```python
- Learning rate: 3e-4 → 1e-5 (linear decay)
- Batch size: 256
- Update frequency: Every step
- Network: [256, 256, 128]
- Clip range: 0.2 (standard)
- Entropy coef: 0.02
```

**ICM Parameters**:
```python
- Alpha: 0.1 (intrinsic reward weight)
- Eta: 1e-3 (ICM learning rate)
- Feature dim: 128
- Forward/inverse loss ratio: 0.9/0.1
```

### Training Coordination

**Warmup Phase** (First 100k steps):
- High-level policy learns slowly (10% LR)
- Low-level policy trains at full rate
- Stabilizes basic navigation and action execution

**Main Training** (Remaining steps):
- Both policies train at full learning rates
- High-level updates every 50 steps
- Low-level updates every step
- Adaptive LR adjusts based on stability

### Stability Monitoring

**Metrics Tracked** (100+):
- Training progress: rewards, lengths, success rates
- Policy performance: losses, entropy, gradient norms
- Stability indicators: gradient ratios, value loss changes
- Hierarchical coordination: transitions, durations, efficiency
- Exploration: ICM rewards, forward/inverse losses
- Environment: switch activations, exit completions

**Adaptive Actions**:
- Reduce LR when gradient norms exceed 10.0
- Reduce LR when value loss exceeds 5.0
- Increase LR when improvement < 1% over 10k steps
- Alert when training becomes unstable

### GPU Optimizations

**H100/A100 Optimizations**:
- TF32 enabled for faster matrix multiplication
- Memory management: Use up to 90% of GPU memory
- Parallel environments: 64 (scalable to 128+)
- Pin memory for faster GPU transfer
- Efficient batching and data loading
