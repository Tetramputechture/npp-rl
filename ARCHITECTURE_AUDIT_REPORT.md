## Code Cleanup Results

### Legacy Code Removed ✅

The following legacy feature extractors were **completely removed** after migration:

1. ❌ `npp_rl/feature_extractors/hgt_multimodal.py` - **REMOVED** (626 lines)
   - Reason: Redundant with `ConfigurableMultimodalExtractor` + `"full_hgt"` config
   - No test coverage

2. ❌ `npp_rl/feature_extractors/vision_free_extractor.py` - **REMOVED** (412 lines)
   - Reason: Redundant with architecture configs
   - No test coverage
   - Claimed "special purpose" but never validated

3. ❌ `MinimalStateExtractor` (was in vision_free_extractor.py) - **REMOVED**
   - Reason: Redundant with `"mlp_baseline"` architecture
   - No test coverage

**Total lines of code removed:** 1,038 lines  
**Total redundant implementations removed:** 3 classes

### Code Quality Improvements ✅

- Single unified feature extraction system
- Zero code duplication across extractors
- Consistent interface for all architectures
- Better test coverage (all architectures tested)
- Clear documentation and migration guide

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Training Runs

1. **Production Training:** Use `full_hgt` architecture

   - All modalities utilized
   - Comprehensive level understanding

2. **Baseline Comparison:** Use `mlp_baseline` architecture

   - No graph processing overhead
   - Good reference point

3. **Systematic Comparison:** Run all 8 architectures
   - Use `ArchitectureTrainer` for automated comparison
   - Same hyperparameters across all runs
   - Results saved per-architecture

### For Future Development

1. **Architecture Additions:**
   - Simply add new config to `ARCHITECTURE_REGISTRY`
   - No need to implement new extractor classes
   - Tests automatically cover new configs

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Run Optuna sweeps per architecture
   - Compare optimal configurations
   - Document architecture-specific best practices

3. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Profile each architecture's computational cost
   - Identify bottlenecks (graph vs vision processing)
   - Optimize slowest components
