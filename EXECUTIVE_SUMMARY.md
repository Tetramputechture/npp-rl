# Executive Summary: RL Training Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-27  
**Training Run:** mlp-baseline-1026 (1M timesteps)  
**Status:** ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

---

## The Problem in 3 Sentences

1. **The agent's reward structure makes level completion impossible to learn** - successful runs result in negative returns due to overwhelming time penalties (-9.0 for fast completion instead of positive reward).

2. **The value function has completely collapsed** - estimated returns degraded from -0.06 to -4.33 (a -6966% change), indicating the critic has learned that all outcomes are catastrophically bad.

3. **The curriculum is stuck** - the agent achieved only 4% success on stage 2 (down from 14.8% peak) and cannot progress, with no mechanism to recover.

---

## Critical Findings

### 1. Reward Scaling Catastrophe ⚠️
```
Current: Fast completion (1000 steps) = +1.0 - 10.0 = -9.0 (NEGATIVE!)
Fixed:   Fast completion (1000 steps) = +10.0 - 0.1 = +9.9 (POSITIVE!)

Problem: Time penalty of -0.01 per step accumulates to -200 over max episode
Solution: Reduce time penalty to -0.0001 (100x) and increase rewards 10x
```

### 2. Value Function Collapse ⚠️
```
Value Estimates:
  Mean:  -0.06 → -4.33  (-6966% change)
  Min:   -0.46 → -7.35
  Max:    0.39 → -0.31  (crossed to negative!)

Problem: Critic learned that everything ends badly (which is true with current rewards!)
Solution: Fix rewards + add VecNormalize + value clipping
```

### 3. Curriculum Stuck ⚠️
```
Stage 0 (simplest): 100% success ✓
Stage 1 (simpler):   68% success (declining)
Stage 2 (simple):     4% success ❌ STUCK for 435 episodes
Stages 3-6:           Never reached

Problem: 70% threshold too high, no regression mechanism
Solution: Adaptive thresholds (60% for stage 2) + regression capability
```

### 4. What's Actually Working ✓
```
Action Entropy: 1.79 (maximum exploration maintained)
Action Distribution: Uniform across all 6 actions
PPO Mechanics: Updates happening correctly, no NaN values

Interpretation: The learning algorithm works fine - the reward signal is broken!
```

## The Fix (Priority Order)

### TIER 1: Emergency Fixes (1-2 hours implementation)

1. **Fix Reward Scaling** (CRITICAL)
   ```python
   LEVEL_COMPLETION_REWARD = 10.0    # was 1.0
   TIME_PENALTY_PER_STEP = -0.0001   # was -0.01 (100x reduction!)
   SWITCH_ACTIVATION_REWARD = 1.0    # was 0.1
   ```

2. **Add Value Normalization** (CRITICAL)
   ```python
   env = VecNormalize(env, norm_reward=True, clip_reward=10.0)
   ```

3. **Fix Curriculum** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   ```python
   ADVANCEMENT_THRESHOLDS = {
       "simple": 0.60,  # was 0.70 (too high)
       "medium": 0.55,
       "complex": 0.50
   }
   ENABLE_REGRESSION = True  # Allow going back to easier stages
   ```

4. **Increase Dense Rewards** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   ```python
   # All navigation/exploration rewards: 10x increase
   # Enable PBRS with objective_weight=1.0, exploration_weight=0.2
   ```

5. **Increase Parallelism** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   ```python
   num_envs = 32      # was 14
   batch_size = 512   # was 256
   n_steps = 2048     # was 1024
   ```

### TIER 2: Important Improvements (implement after validating Tier 1)

- Learning rate scheduling (constant → linear decay)
- Entropy coefficient annealing
- Larger value network architecture
- Mixed curriculum training

---

## Expected Outcomes

### After Emergency Fixes (Week 1):
- ✅ Value estimates return to [-5, 5] range
- ✅ Success rate stops declining
- ✅ Positive returns for successful episodes
- ✅ Agent can progress past stage 2

### After Full Implementation (Week 2-3):
- ✅ 60%+ success on stages 0-3
- ✅ Reaches curriculum stages 4-5
- ✅ Stable value function (std < 5)
- ✅ Clear learning trends in all metrics

### Performance Prediction:
```
Current State:
├─ Stage reached: 2 (stuck)
├─ Success rate: 4% (declining)
└─ Value estimates: -4.33 (collapsed)

After Fixes (1M steps):
├─ Stage reached: 4-5 ✓
├─ Success rate: 60%+ on stages 0-3 ✓
└─ Value estimates: [-2, 2] (stable) ✓
```

## Implementation Priority

**DO FIRST** (Stop the bleeding):
1. Update reward constants in `reward_constants.py`
2. Add VecNormalize wrapper in training script
3. Adjust curriculum thresholds

**DO NEXT** (Enable learning):
4. Increase environment parallelism
5. Enable PBRS reward shaping
6. Add value function clipping

**DO LATER** (Optimize):
7. Learning rate scheduling
8. Entropy coefficient decay
9. Advanced curriculum features

## Risk Assessment

### High Confidence Fixes (>90%):
- Reward scaling correction
- Value normalization
- Curriculum threshold adjustment

### Medium Confidence (70%):
- Dense reward shaping effectiveness
- Curriculum regression mechanism
- Increased parallelism benefits

### Needs Validation (<50%):
- Exact optimal hyperparameters
- Architecture improvements
- Advanced techniques (HER, PBT)

---

## Bottom Line

**Current training will not produce a working agent.**

The issues are **fundamental** (reward structure makes success impossible) but **fixable** (well-understood techniques).

**Estimated time to working agent:**
- Implementation: 1-2 hours
- Validation: 3-5 hours training
- Full results: 2-3 days

**Confidence:** High (>90%) that Phase 1 fixes will enable learning.
