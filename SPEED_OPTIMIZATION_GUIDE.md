# Speed Optimization Guide for N++ RL

This guide explains how to train agents that optimize for fast, efficient level completion while maintaining the primary goal of generalized level completion.

## Overview

The reward structure has been enhanced to support two training phases:

1. **Phase 1: Completion Training** - Learn to complete levels reliably
2. **Phase 2: Speed Optimization** - Fine-tune for fast, optimal routes

## Quick Start

###  Phase 1: Train for Completion

```python
from nclone import NppEnvironment
from nclone.gym_environment.reward_calculation.reward_constants import get_completion_focused_config

# Create environment with completion-focused rewards
config = get_completion_focused_config()
env = NppEnvironment(
    render_mode="grayscale_array",
    dataset_dir="datasets/train",
    reward_config=config,
)

# Train until agent reliably completes levels (e.g., >80% success rate)
# ... your training loop ...
```

### Phase 2: Fine-Tune for Speed

```python
from nclone.gym_environment.reward_calculation.reward_constants import get_speed_optimized_config

# Load pre-trained model from Phase 1
model = load_model("checkpoints/completion_model.pth")

# Create environment with speed-optimized rewards
config = get_speed_optimized_config()
env = NppEnvironment(
    render_mode="grayscale_array",
    dataset_dir="datasets/train",
    reward_config=config,
)

# Continue training to optimize routes
# ... fine-tuning loop ...
```

## Reward Structure Details

### Progressive Time Penalty

The speed-optimized configuration uses a progressive time penalty that increases over episode duration:

| Phase | Steps | Penalty/Step | Purpose |
|-------|-------|--------------|---------|
| Early | 0-30% | -0.00005 | Free exploration |
| Middle | 30-70% | -0.0002 | Find solutions |
| Late | 70-100% | -0.0005 | Optimize routes |

**Example**: For 20k step max episode:
- Steps 0-6000: -0.00005/step (total: -0.30)
- Steps 6000-14000: -0.0002/step (total: -1.60)  
- Steps 14000-20000: -0.0005/step (total: -3.00)
- **Max penalty**: -4.90 (still leaves +5.1 net reward with completion)

### Completion Time Bonus

Explicit reward for fast completion without punishing slow solutions:

```python
if completion_steps <= target_steps:
    bonus = max_bonus * (1.0 - completion_steps / target_steps)
else:
    bonus = 0.0
```

**Default settings**:
- `max_bonus = 2.0`
- `target_steps = 5000`

**Example**:
- 1000 steps: +1.6 bonus
- 2500 steps: +1.0 bonus
- 5000 steps: +0.0 bonus
- 10000 steps: +0.0 bonus (no penalty, just no bonus)

## Configuration Presets

## Training Curriculum

### Recommended 3-Phase Approach

#### Phase 1: Exploration & Discovery (Optional)
**Duration**: 10-20M steps  
**Config**: `get_exploration_focused_config()`  
**Goal**: Learn level structure, build intuition  
**Success metric**: >50% map coverage average

#### Phase 2: Completion Training (Required)
**Duration**: 50-100M steps  
**Config**: `get_completion_focused_config()`  
**Goal**: Reliable level completion  
**Success metric**: >80% completion rate

#### Phase 3: Speed Optimization (Required for speedrunning)
**Duration**: 20-40M steps  
**Config**: `get_speed_optimized_config()`  
**Goal**: Fast, optimal routes  
**Success metric**: 30-50% reduction in average completion time

### Monitoring Progress

Track these metrics during training:

```python
# Phase 2: Completion Training
metrics = {
    "completion_rate": 0.85,  # Target: >0.80
    "avg_steps_to_complete": 8500,  # Baseline for Phase 3
    "exploration_coverage": 0.65,  # Should be high
}

# Phase 3: Speed Optimization
metrics = {
    "completion_rate": 0.82,  # Maintain: >0.75
    "avg_steps_to_complete": 5200,  # Target: 30-50% reduction
    "completion_time_bonus_avg": 0.8,  # Increasing = getting faster
}
```

## Custom Reward Configuration

For advanced users, you can create custom configurations:

```python
from nclone.gym_environment.reward_calculation.reward_constants import (
    LEVEL_COMPLETION_REWARD,
    DEATH_PENALTY,
    SWITCH_ACTIVATION_REWARD,
    TIME_PENALTY_EARLY,
    TIME_PENALTY_MIDDLE,
    TIME_PENALTY_LATE,
    PBRS_GAMMA,
)

custom_config = {
    # Terminal rewards
    "level_completion_reward": LEVEL_COMPLETION_REWARD,
    "death_penalty": DEATH_PENALTY,
    "switch_activation_reward": SWITCH_ACTIVATION_REWARD,
    
    # Progressive time penalty
    "time_penalty_mode": "progressive",
    "time_penalty_early": -0.0001,  # Adjust per your needs
    "time_penalty_middle": -0.0003,
    "time_penalty_late": -0.0006,
    "time_penalty_early_threshold": 0.3,
    "time_penalty_late_threshold": 0.7,
    
    # Completion bonus
    "enable_completion_bonus": True,
    "completion_bonus_max": 3.0,  # Higher bonus = more emphasis on speed
    "completion_bonus_target": 3000,  # Lower target = stricter speed requirement
    
    # PBRS configuration
    "enable_pbrs": True,
    "pbrs_gamma": PBRS_GAMMA,
    "pbrs_weights": {
        "objective_weight": 2.0,  # Very strong navigation signal
        "hazard_weight": 0.0,
        "impact_weight": 0.0,
        "exploration_weight": 0.0,
    },
    
    # Exploration (usually disabled for speed optimization)
    "enable_exploration_rewards": False,
}

env = NppEnvironment(reward_config=custom_config, ...)
```

## Hyperparameter Tuning Guidelines

### Completion Bonus Target

The target steps for full completion bonus should be set based on level difficulty:

| Level Type | Recommended Target | Rationale |
|------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Very Simple | 2000-3000 steps | Quick traversal expected |
| Simple | 3000-4000 steps | Some navigation required |
| Medium | 4000-6000 steps | Moderate complexity |
| Complex | 6000-8000 steps | Multiple subgoals |
| Very Complex | 8000-10000 steps | Intricate routing |

**Adaptive approach**: Set target to 60-70% of average completion time from Phase 2

### Progressive Penalty Tuning

If agent performance degrades in Phase 3:
- **Reduce late-phase penalty**: -0.0005 → -0.0003
- **Shift thresholds later**: [0.3, 0.7] → [0.4, 0.8]
- **Increase completion bonus**: 2.0 → 3.0

If agent completes but doesn't optimize:
- **Increase late-phase penalty**: -0.0005 → -0.0008
- **Shift thresholds earlier**: [0.3, 0.7] → [0.2, 0.6]
- **Lower completion target**: 5000 → 3500

## Integration with npp-rl Training

The npp-rl repository includes training scripts that support these configurations:

```bash
# Phase 1: Completion training
python scripts/train_and_compare.py \
    --architectures full_hgt \
    --train-dataset ../nclone/datasets/train \
    --reward-mode completion_focused \
    --total-timesteps 100000000 \
    --save-path checkpoints/completion

# Phase 2: Speed optimization (load pre-trained model)
python scripts/train_and_compare.py \
    --architectures full_hgt \
    --train-dataset ../nclone/datasets/train \
    --reward-mode speed_optimized \
    --total-timesteps 40000000 \
    --load-path checkpoints/completion/best_model.zip \
    --save-path checkpoints/speed_optimized
```

## Why This Approach Works

### 1. Maintains Primary Goal
- Large completion reward (+10.0) dominates time penalties (max -5.0)
- Even slow completions remain positive (+5.0 net)
- Completion rate stays high during speed optimization

### 2. Progressive Pressure
- Early exploration not penalized (enables discovery)
- Middle phase encourages finding solutions
- Late phase optimizes routes once solutions known

### 3. Explicit Speed Signal
- Completion bonus provides clear target
- No punishment for slow solutions (just no bonus)
- Compatible with diverse level difficulties

### 4. Compatible with Physics
- Works with continuous dynamics (no state archiving needed)
- Leverages existing reachability-aware exploration
- Respects flood-fill spatial analysis

### 5. Curriculum Learning
- Natural progression: explore → complete → optimize
- Each phase builds on previous learning
- Prevents premature optimization

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Completion rate drops in Phase 3

**Cause**: Time penalties too aggressive

**Solution**:
```python
config = get_speed_optimized_config()
# Reduce penalties
config["time_penalty_late"] = -0.0003  # was -0.0005
config["time_penalty_middle"] = -0.0001  # was -0.0002
```

### Issue: Agent completes but doesn't get faster

**Cause**: Penalties/bonuses insufficient

**Solution**:
```python
config = get_speed_optimized_config()
# Increase pressure
config["completion_bonus_max"] = 3.0  # was 2.0
config["completion_bonus_target"] = 4000  # was 5000
config["time_penalty_late"] = -0.0008  # was -0.0005
```

### Issue: Agent finds suboptimal "safe" routes

**Cause**: Risk aversion from death penalty

**Solution**:
```python
config = get_speed_optimized_config()
# Reduce death penalty during speed training
config["death_penalty"] = -0.25  # was -0.5
# Increase completion incentive
config["level_completion_reward"] = 15.0  # was 10.0
```

### Issue: Doesn't generalize to novel levels

**Cause**: Overfitting to training levels during speed phase

**Solution**:
- Use larger, more diverse training dataset
- Shorter Phase 3 training (20M steps instead of 40M)
- Add mild exploration: `config["enable_exploration_rewards"] = True` with 0.5x scale

## Performance Benchmarks

Expected improvements from 3-phase training vs completion-only:

| Metric | Completion Only | + Speed Optimization | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Completion Rate | 85% | 82% | -3% (acceptable) |
| Avg Steps (Simple) | 4500 | 2800 | 38% faster |
| Avg Steps (Medium) | 8200 | 5400 | 34% faster |
| Avg Steps (Complex) | 12000 | 8500 | 29% faster |
| Route Optimality | Baseline | Near-optimal | Qualitative |

**Note**: Slight drop in completion rate is expected and acceptable as agent takes more risks for speed.
