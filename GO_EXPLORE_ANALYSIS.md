# Go-Explore Integration Analysis for N++ RL

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Paper**: Ecoffet et al. (2019) "Go-Explore: a New Approach for Hard-Exploration Problems" (arXiv:1901.10995)

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the Go-Explore algorithm and its applicability to the N++ reinforcement learning domain. After thorough review of both the paper and existing nclone/npp-rl implementations, we find that:

1. **Existing systems already incorporate key Go-Explore principles** through reachability-aware intrinsic curiosity
2. **The current approach is well-suited for online RL** which is the primary use case
3. **Go-Explore's explicit state archiving would add value for specific scenarios** (see recommendations)
4. **Reward structure modifications can better encourage optimal routing** while maintaining generalization

## 1. Go-Explore Core Principles

### 1.1 The Three Key Principles

Go-Explore addresses hard-exploration problems through three core principles:

1. **Remember previously visited states**: Maintain an archive of interesting states encountered during exploration
2. **First return, then explore**: Instead of adding exploration noise when returning to promising states, first deterministically return to the state, then explore from it
3. **Solve deterministically, then robustify**: In simulated environments, solve with determinism during exploration, then use imitation learning to create robust policies

### 1.2 Problems Addressed

#### Detachment
- **Definition**: RL agents driven by intrinsic motivation can become "detached" from promising exploration frontiers
- **Cause**: Intrinsic rewards are consumable - once an area is explored, it provides little motivation to return
- **Effect**: Agents may explore one area, then by chance explore another, losing the ability to return to the original frontier
- **Solution**: Explicit state archiving ensures promising states are never forgotten

#### Derailment
- **Definition**: Stochastic exploration mechanisms can "derail" attempts to return to known promising states
- **Cause**: The longer and more precise the action sequence needed to reach a state, the more likely random perturbations will prevent reaching it
- **Effect**: Agents struggle to consistently return to states with high intrinsic reward
- **Solution**: Separate "return" phase (deterministic) from "explore" phase (stochastic)

### 1.3 Two-Phase Algorithm

#### Phase 1: Explore Until Solved
```
1. Maintain archive of discovered states (cells)
2. Select promising state from archive
3. Return to that state (without exploration noise)
4. Explore from that state (with exploration mechanisms)
5. Update archive with newly discovered states
6. Repeat until problem solved
```

**Cell Representation**: States are discretized into "cells" for memory efficiency (e.g., downsampled frames)

#### Phase 2: Robustify (if necessary)
- Use Backward Algorithm (Salimans & Chen, 2018) or similar imitation learning
- Start near end of trajectory, learn with RL to match/exceed performance
- Gradually move starting point earlier in trajectory
- Results in robust policy that handles stochasticity

## 2. N++ Domain Characteristics

### 2.1 Alignment with Go-Explore Requirements

**Favorable characteristics:**
- ✅ Deterministic physics simulator (nclone) available
- ✅ Sparse reward structure (switch, exit, death)
- ✅ Hard exploration problem requiring long action sequences
- ✅ Clear subgoal structure (find switch → activate switch → reach exit)

**Critical Differences from Montezuma's Revenge (Atari):**
- ❌ **Continuous physics makes state archiving impractical**: Unlike Atari's discrete state transitions, N++ has continuous physics with gravity, friction, drag, spring mechanics, wall slides, and wall jumps
- ❌ **Cannot reliably "return" to archived states**: Even tiny differences in position/velocity compound rapidly due to physics integration, making Go-Explore's "return then explore" principle impossible to implement directly
- ❌ **State discretization is problematic**: Many different physical states (position + velocity) map to the same visual cell, but have completely different future trajectories
- ❌ **No predetermined path calculation**: Physics interactions make it impossible to calculate all possible paths beforehand - must rely on simulation
- ⚠️ **Each level has unique structure**: Procedurally generated/diverse dataset means no single level to master
- ✅ **Flood-fill reachability analysis available**: nclone provides fast (<1ms) reachability estimates that account for level geometry

### 2.2 Why Go-Explore's Core Algorithm Doesn't Apply to N++

#### The "Return to State" Problem

Go-Explore's Phase 1 relies on the ability to **deterministically return to an archived state**, either by:
1. Restoring simulator state from memory (Atari)
2. Replaying a sequence of actions from initial state (Atari)

**This doesn't work for continuous physics platforms because:**

```
Example: Two ninja states that look identical visually
State A: position=(240, 360), velocity=(2.5, 0.1)
State B: position=(240.5, 360), velocity=(2.4, -0.05)

Visual cell: Both map to grid cell (10, 15) - look the same!

After 60 frames of physics simulation:
State A: ninja is at (390, 420), approaching a wall
State B: ninja has fallen into a pit at (385, 580)

Completely different outcomes from "the same" cell!
```

The continuous physics system means:
- **Position + velocity** matter, not just position
- Small velocity differences → large position differences (integration over time)
- Wall collisions, friction, drag, gravity all compound errors
- **No way to reliably return to an exact physical state** without perfect state restoration

#### Why Visual/Grid Cells Fail

Go-Explore uses downsampled visual representations as "cells" to discretize state space. For N++:

```python
# Go-Explore cell: 11x8 downsampled grid of game screen
cell = downsample_screen(game_state)  # Visual appearance only

# Problem: This cell conflates many physical states
physical_states_in_cell = [
    (pos=(240.0, 360.0), vel=(3.0, 0.0)),    # Moving right fast
    (pos=(240.5, 360.5), vel=(-2.0, 0.2)),   # Moving left slower
    (pos=(240.2, 360.1), vel=(0.1, -1.5)),   # Falling
    # ... thousands more combinations
]

# All look the same visually, but lead to completely different futures
```

**The reachability-based approach is superior** because:
- Uses flood-fill to determine which grid cells are geometrically reachable
- Doesn't try to archive exact physical states (impossible with continuous physics)
- Provides spatial coverage information without physics prediction
- Works with the continuous dynamics rather than fighting them

### 2.3 What N++ Has Instead: Reachability-Based Exploration

The existing nclone/npp-rl system uses a **fundamentally different** but more appropriate approach for continuous physics domains:

#### Reachability-Aware ICM
**Location**: `npp_rl/intrinsic/icm.py`, `npp_rl/intrinsic/reachability_exploration.py`

**Features**:
- Standard ICM (forward/inverse models) for prediction-based curiosity
- Reachability modulation: scales curiosity based on spatial accessibility
- Frontier detection: boosts exploration of newly accessible areas
- Strategic weighting: prioritizes exploration near objectives
- **Already references Go-Explore** (Ecoffet et al., 2019) in documentation

**Key insight**: This addresses the "detachment" problem differently:
- Instead of explicit state archiving, uses reachability analysis to maintain awareness of promising areas
- Modulates intrinsic rewards to keep frontier areas attractive
- Leverages nclone's fast reachability computation (<1ms)

#### Multi-Scale Exploration Rewards
**Location**: `nclone/gym_environment/reward_calculation/exploration_reward_calculator.py`

**Features**:
- Cell-level rewards (24x24 pixels): 0.01
- Medium area (4x4 cells): 0.01
- Large area (8x8 cells): 0.01
- Very large area (16x16 cells): 0.01
- Total possible per-step exploration: 0.04

**Relation to Go-Explore**: Similar to visit counting in Go-Explore archive, but implemented as consumable per-step rewards rather than selection probabilities

#### Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS)
**Location**: `nclone/gym_environment/reward_calculation/pbrs_potentials.py`

**Features**:
- Policy-invariant shaping (Ng et al., 1999)
- Objective distance potential
- Hazard proximity potential
- Exploration potential
- Gamma matches PPO discount (0.999)

**Relation to Go-Explore**: Provides continuous navigation signal without explicit state archiving

### 2.3 Why Current Approach Works Well for Online RL

The existing system is optimized for **online reinforcement learning** where:
1. Policy is trained continuously during environment interaction
2. Experience is consumed through gradient updates
3. Generalization across diverse levels is critical
4. Sample efficiency matters but not as much as final performance

**Advantages over explicit Go-Explore**:
- No memory overhead for state archive (important with diverse level dataset)
- Continuous learning rather than two distinct phases
- Better generalization through policy gradients rather than trajectory memorization
- Reachability awareness is more adaptive than fixed cell representations

## 3. Gap Analysis: What Can Be Learned from Go-Explore

### 3.1 Go-Explore's Core Algorithm is NOT Applicable

**Critical Assessment**: Given N++'s continuous physics system with gravity, friction, drag, spring mechanics, and complex collision dynamics, **Go-Explore's Phase 1 (state archiving and deterministic return) cannot be directly implemented**.

**Why:**
1. Cannot discretize continuous physical states into reliable cells
2. Cannot deterministically return to archived states due to velocity sensitivity
3. Cannot calculate paths beforehand - must simulate physics
4. Flood-fill reachability already provides spatial awareness without state archiving

**Conclusion**: The existing reachability-aware ICM is the correct approach for this domain.

### 3.2 Conceptual Insights from Go-Explore That ARE Already Incorporated

The existing npp-rl system **already implements the spirit of Go-Explore** in ways adapted for continuous physics:

#### Insight 1: "Remember Previously Visited States" 
**Go-Explore approach**: Archive discrete cells with trajectories  
**N++ adaptation**: ✅ Multi-scale exploration tracking (cell, 4x4, 8x8, 16x16 grids) + reachability-aware history  
**Location**: `nclone/gym_environment/reward_calculation/exploration_reward_calculator.py`

#### Insight 2: "First Return, Then Explore"
**Go-Explore approach**: Deterministically return to archived state, then explore  
**N++ adaptation**: ✅ Frontier detection + strategic weighting toward promising unexplored areas  
**Location**: `npp_rl/intrinsic/reachability_exploration.py` - detects newly accessible areas after state changes

#### Insight 3: "Solve Deterministically, Then Robustify"
**Go-Explore approach**: Two-phase training with imitation learning  
**N++ adaptation**: ⚠️ Could add curriculum phasing (exploration → completion → speed optimization)  
**Current**: Single-phase online RL (appropriate for generalization objective)

### 3.3 What SHOULD Be Added: Speed Optimization Through Reward Structure

The one area where enhancement is needed is **encouraging optimal, efficient routes** while maintaining the primary goal of level completion. The current time penalty (-0.0001/step) is very small and doesn't strongly encourage speed optimization.

**Primary Goal (unchanged)**: Generalized level completion across diverse levels  
**Secondary Goal (new emphasis)**: Learn efficient, optimal routes as a byproduct of fine-tuning

**Why this is the right addition:**
1. ✅ Directly addresses user request for speed optimization
2. ✅ Maintains primary completion goal (larger terminal rewards)
3. ✅ Compatible with continuous physics (no state archiving needed)
4. ✅ Works with existing exploration mechanisms
5. ✅ Enables curriculum phasing (completion first, then speed)
6. ✅ Backward compatible (config-based, optional)

## 4. Recommendations

### 4.1 Core Assessment

**Critical Finding**: **Go-Explore's core algorithm (Phase 1 state archiving) is NOT applicable to N++ due to continuous physics**. The existing reachability-aware ICM is already the correct approach and incorporates Go-Explore's conceptual insights in a way that works with continuous dynamics.

**Primary Recommendation**: **Enhance reward structure to encourage speed optimization** - this directly addresses the user request while respecting the physics constraints.

**Rationale**:
1. ✅ Current system already implements Go-Explore spirit via reachability-aware exploration
2. ❌ Cannot implement Go-Explore's state archiving due to continuous physics (gravity, friction, drag, momentum)
3. ✅ Speed optimization through rewards is practical and effective
4. ✅ Maintains primary goal (generalized completion) while adding secondary goal (efficiency)
5. ✅ Compatible with existing exploration mechanisms

### 4.2 DO NOT Implement: Go-Explore State Archiving

**Explicitly NOT recommended**: Direct implementation of Go-Explore Phase 1 (state archive with deterministic return)

**Why not:**
- Continuous physics makes state discretization unreliable
- Cannot calculate paths beforehand - physics must be simulated
- Velocity-sensitive dynamics make "return to state" impossible without exact state restoration
- Visual/grid cells conflate many different physical states with divergent futures
- Flood-fill reachability already provides better spatial awareness for this domain

**Alternative**: The existing reachability-aware ICM with frontier detection already captures the valuable insights from Go-Explore in a way that works with continuous physics.

### 4.3 DO Implement: Enhanced Reward Structure for Speed Optimization

The current time penalty is very small (-0.0001/step). To better encourage optimal routing while maintaining completion as primary goal:

#### Option 1: Progressive Time Penalty (Recommended)
```python
def compute_time_penalty(step, max_steps=20000):
    """
    Progressive time penalty that increases with episode length.
    
    Early steps: minimal penalty (explore freely)
    Middle steps: moderate penalty (find solutions)
    Late steps: high penalty (optimize routes)
    """
    if step < max_steps * 0.3:  # First 30%: exploration phase
        return -0.00005
    elif step < max_steps * 0.7:  # Next 40%: solution phase
        return -0.0002
    else:  # Final 30%: optimization phase
        return -0.0005
    
    # Max penalty at 20k steps: 
    # (6000 * -0.00005) + (8000 * -0.0002) + (6000 * -0.0005) = -5.2
    # Still leaves +4.8 net reward with completion
```

**Advantages**:
- Doesn't punish early exploration
- Encourages finding solutions first
- Optimizes routes in later training
- Maintains positive reward for completion

#### Option 2: Completion Time Bonus
```python
def compute_completion_bonus(completion_steps, target_steps=5000):
    """
    Bonus reward for fast completion.
    
    Complements rather than replaces base rewards.
    """
    if completion_steps <= target_steps:
        # Linear bonus: 0.0 to +2.0
        return 2.0 * (1.0 - completion_steps / target_steps)
    else:
        # No bonus (but no penalty either)
        return 0.0
```

**Advantages**:
- Explicitly rewards speed
- Doesn't punish slow solutions
- Easy to tune with target_steps parameter
- Compatible with curriculum (different targets per level)

#### Option 3: Multi-Objective Reward (Research Direction)
```python
def compute_multi_objective_reward(completion, steps, max_steps):
    """
    Multi-objective reward with separate completion and efficiency components.
    
    Allows training with different trade-offs.
    """
    rewards = {
        'completion': 10.0 if completion else 0.0,
        'efficiency': -0.001 * (steps / max_steps),  # Normalized penalty
        'exploration': ...,  # Existing exploration rewards
    }
    
    # Can train with different weightings
    # Or use multi-objective optimization (Pareto frontier)
    return weighted_sum(rewards, weights)
```

**Advantages**:
- Clean separation of objectives
- Enables multi-objective training
- Better analysis of trade-offs
- Research-oriented

#### Recommended Implementation: Option 1 + Option 2

Combine progressive time penalty (for all training) with completion time bonus (for fine-tuning phase):

```python
# nclone/gym_environment/reward_calculation/reward_constants.py

# Add new constants
TIME_PENALTY_EARLY = -0.00005      # Steps 0-30%
TIME_PENALTY_MIDDLE = -0.0002      # Steps 30-70%
TIME_PENALTY_LATE = -0.0005        # Steps 70-100%

COMPLETION_TIME_BONUS_MAX = 2.0    # Max bonus for instant completion
COMPLETION_TIME_TARGET = 5000      # Target steps for full bonus

def get_speed_optimized_config() -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Reward configuration that encourages fast, optimal routes.
    
    Use after initial training for fine-tuning speedrunning behavior.
    """
    return {
        # Terminal rewards
        "level_completion_reward": LEVEL_COMPLETION_REWARD,
        "death_penalty": DEATH_PENALTY,
        "switch_activation_reward": SWITCH_ACTIVATION_REWARD,
        
        # Progressive time penalty
        "time_penalty_schedule": "progressive",  # vs "fixed"
        "time_penalty_early": TIME_PENALTY_EARLY,
        "time_penalty_middle": TIME_PENALTY_MIDDLE,
        "time_penalty_late": TIME_PENALTY_LATE,
        
        # Completion time bonus
        "enable_completion_bonus": True,
        "completion_bonus_max": COMPLETION_TIME_BONUS_MAX,
        "completion_bonus_target": COMPLETION_TIME_TARGET,
        
        # PBRS (focus on efficiency)
        "enable_pbrs": True,
        "pbrs_gamma": PBRS_GAMMA,
        "pbrs_weights": {
            "objective_weight": PBRS_OBJECTIVE_WEIGHT * 1.5,  # Stronger nav signal
            "hazard_weight": 0.0,  # Speed over safety
            "impact_weight": 0.0,
            "exploration_weight": 0.0,  # Minimal exploration in fine-tuning
        },
        
        # Reduced exploration (already know how to complete)
        "enable_exploration_rewards": False,
    }
```

### 6.3 Domain-Specific Considerations for N++

**Physics-Based Platformers vs Discrete Games**:
- N++ has continuous physics (momentum, acceleration, precise timing)
- Go-Explore's cell discretization needs adaptation for continuous state space
- Reachability analysis is crucial (some cells may be permanently unreachable)
- Frame-perfect inputs are common (input buffers in nclone handle this)

**Speedrunning in Platformers**:
- Key techniques: momentum preservation, entity manipulation, route optimization
- Multiple valid solutions with different time trade-offs
- Optimal routes often discovered through extensive human experimentation
- Our approach: let RL discover optimal routes through progressive time penalties

**Generalization Requirements**:
- Unlike Montezuma's Revenge (fixed levels), N++ training uses diverse level dataset
- Policy must generalize to novel level structures
- Go-Explore's trajectory memorization not suitable for generalization
- Solution: Use Go-Explore for demonstrations, ICM for policy training

## 7. Testing and Validation

### 7.1 Reward Structure Validation

**Test scenarios**:
1. **Baseline**: Train with current reward structure, measure completion times
2. **Progressive Penalty**: Train with new progressive penalty, compare completion times
3. **Completion Bonus**: Add completion bonus, compare route optimality
4. **Combined**: Test progressive + bonus, verify no degradation in completion rate

**Success metrics**:
- Completion rate maintained (>= 90% of baseline)
- Average completion time reduced (target: 30-50% faster)
- No overfitting to specific routes
- Generalization to novel levels preserved

### 7.2 Go-Explore Module Validation

**Test scenarios**:
1. **Single Level**: Train Go-Explore on one level, measure solution time vs ICM
2. **Demonstration Quality**: Generate demos, train BC agent, compare to human demos
3. **Curriculum Assessment**: Use archive statistics to rank level difficulty

**Success metrics**:
- Finds solutions faster than ICM for single-level scenario
- Generated demonstrations lead to >70% performance in BC training
- Difficulty rankings correlate with human assessment

## 8. Conclusion

### 8.1 Key Findings

After comprehensive analysis of the Go-Explore paper (Ecoffet et al., 2019) and the npp-rl/nclone codebase:

1. **Go-Explore's core algorithm (Phase 1 state archiving) is NOT applicable** to N++ due to continuous physics with gravity, friction, drag, spring mechanics, and complex collision dynamics. State discretization is unreliable and "returning to states" is impossible without exact state restoration.

2. **The existing reachability-aware ICM already implements Go-Explore's conceptual insights** in a way that works with continuous physics:
   - Frontier detection for newly accessible areas
   - Reachability-based spatial awareness using flood-fill (<1ms)
   - Strategic weighting toward objectives
   - Multi-scale exploration tracking

3. **The system is well-designed for its primary use case**: cross-level generalization with online RL, where policy gradients and diverse experience lead to better generalization than trajectory memorization would.

### 8.2 What We're Implementing

**PRIMARY ENHANCEMENT: Speed-Optimized Reward Structure**

Address the user's request for "optimal routes for level completion (fastest completion)" through:

1. **Progressive time penalties**: Early exploration freedom, increasing pressure for efficiency
2. **Completion time bonuses**: Explicit rewards for fast completion
3. **Speed-optimized configuration**: Easy-to-use preset for fine-tuning
4. **Training curriculum guidance**: Clear workflow for completion → speed optimization

This approach:
- ✅ Directly addresses user's speed optimization goal
- ✅ Maintains primary objective (generalized level completion)
- ✅ Works with continuous physics (no state archiving needed)
- ✅ Compatible with existing exploration mechanisms
- ✅ Backward compatible and low risk
- ✅ Respects physics constraints (relies on flood-fill reachability, not predetermined paths)

### 8.3 What We're NOT Implementing (and Why)

**Go-Explore State Archiving**: Explicitly NOT recommended due to:
- Continuous physics makes state discretization unreliable
- Cannot calculate all possible paths beforehand (must simulate physics)
- Velocity-sensitive dynamics prevent reliable "return to state"
- Flood-fill reachability provides better spatial awareness for this domain
- Existing ICM already captures the valuable conceptual insights

### 8.4 Respect for Existing System Design

The npp-rl/nclone system shows sophisticated understanding of:
- Exploration challenges in continuous physics environments
- Trade-offs between exploration and exploitation
- Integration of reachability analysis with intrinsic motivation
- Already references Go-Explore (Ecoffet et al., 2019) in documentation

Our enhancements **build on this strong foundation** rather than replacing it. The system's authors clearly considered these design choices carefully, and the reachability-aware ICM is the correct approach for continuous physics platformers.

### 8.5 Final Recommendation

Implement progressive reward structure for speed optimization as the practical, effective solution that:
1. Addresses the user's stated goals
2. Respects the physics constraints
3. Leverages existing exploration mechanisms
4. Maintains generalization capabilities
5. Provides clear path to optimal route learning

The Go-Explore paper provides valuable conceptual insights, but its specific algorithm is designed for discrete state spaces (Atari) and doesn't transfer to continuous physics domains. The existing reachability-aware approach is superior for N++.
