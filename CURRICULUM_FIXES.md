# Curriculum Progression Bug Fixes

## Issues Identified

Based on the training log analysis, three issues were found in the curriculum learning system:

### 1. Debug Print Statement Instead of Logger

**Issue**: Line 297 in `curriculum_manager.py` used `print()` instead of `logger.debug()`

```python
# BEFORE
print(f"Recording episode for stage: {stage}, success: {success}")

# AFTER
logger.debug(f"Recording episode for stage: {stage}, success: {success}")
```

**Impact**: 
- Caused console spam with "Recording episode for stage: simplest, success: True" messages
- These messages bypassed the logging system and couldn't be filtered
- Made training logs cluttered and hard to read

**Observed in logs**:
```
Recording episode for stage: simplest, success: True
Recording episode for stage: simplest, success: True
Recording episode for stage: simplest, success: True
... (many more)
```

### 2. Duplicate "Early Advancement" Log Messages

**Issue**: The `get_stage_performance()` method logged advancement criteria checks, but this method was called twice during the advancement flow:

1. First call in `CurriculumVecEnvWrapper.step_wait()` (line 351):
   ```python
   stage_perf = self.curriculum_manager.get_stage_performance(current_stage)
   ```

2. Second call in `CurriculumManager.check_advancement()` (line 442):
   ```python
   perf = self.get_stage_performance(self.current_stage)
   ```

**Impact**:
- Every advancement check resulted in duplicate log messages
- Made it confusing to understand when advancement actually happened

**Observed in logs**:
```
2025-10-26 11:04:24 [INFO] [Early Advancement] Stage 'simplest': 100.0% success after only 30 episodes (threshold: 90.0%)
2025-10-26 11:04:24 [INFO] [Early Advancement] Stage 'simplest': 100.0% success after only 30 episodes (threshold: 90.0%)
```

**Fix**: 
- Removed logging from `get_stage_performance()` 
- Moved all advancement criteria logging to `check_advancement()` 
- Now logs advancement criteria ONCE, right before actually advancing

**New behavior**:
```python
# In check_advancement(), BEFORE advancing stages:
if perf.get("can_early_advance", False):
    logger.info(
        f"[Early Advancement] Stage '{prev_stage}': {perf['success_rate']:.1%} success "
        f"after only {perf['episodes']} episodes (threshold: {self.EARLY_ADVANCEMENT_THRESHOLD:.1%})"
    )

# Then advance
self.current_stage_idx += 1
self.current_stage = self.CURRICULUM_ORDER[self.current_stage_idx]

# Then log full advancement summary
logger.info("=" * 70)
logger.info("✨ CURRICULUM ADVANCEMENT! ✨")
...
```

### 3. "Stale Stage" in Episode Recording (Not a Bug!)

**Observation in logs**:
```
2025-10-26 11:04:24 [INFO] ✨ CURRICULUM ADVANCEMENT! ✨
2025-10-26 11:04:24 [INFO] Previous stage: simplest
2025-10-26 11:04:24 [INFO] New stage: simpler

... later ...

2025-10-26 11:06:37 [INFO] [Early Advancement] Stage 'simplest': 100.0% success after only 31 episodes (threshold: 90.0%)
```

**Analysis**: 
This is **NOT a bug** - it's correct behavior! Here's why:

1. **Episode stage is set at reset time**: When an episode starts (at `reset()`), the curriculum stage is recorded in the info dict
2. **Episodes take time**: An episode that starts before advancement can finish after advancement
3. **Info dict preserves start state**: The episode's stage info reflects when it started, not when it finished

**Timeline example**:
```
T=0:    Episode A starts on stage 'simplest' (info['curriculum_stage'] = 'simplest')
T=10:   Curriculum advances to 'simpler'
T=15:   Episode A finishes successfully
        → Recorded as 'simplest' success (correct! it started on simplest)
T=16:   Episode B starts on stage 'simpler' (info['curriculum_stage'] = 'simpler')
```

**Why this is correct**:
- Episodes should be attributed to the stage they were sampled from
- This prevents data corruption (recording a 'simplest' episode as 'simpler')
- Performance metrics remain accurate for each stage

## Summary of Changes

### File: `npp_rl/training/curriculum_manager.py`

**Change 1** (Line 297):
```python
- print(f"Recording episode for stage: {stage}, success: {success}")
+ logger.debug(f"Recording episode for stage: {stage}, success: {success}")
```

**Change 2** (Lines 377-389):
Removed logging from advancement criteria checks in `get_stage_performance()`:
```python
# Removed these log statements:
- logger.info(f"[Early Advancement] Stage '{stage}': ...")
- logger.info(f"[Trend Bonus] Stage '{stage}': ...")

# Added comments explaining where logging moved:
+ # Note: Logging moved to check_advancement() to avoid duplicate logs
```

**Change 3** (Lines 441-451):
Added advancement criteria logging to `check_advancement()` before advancing:
```python
+ # Log advancement criteria that were met (before advancing)
+ if perf.get("can_early_advance", False):
+     logger.info(
+         f"[Early Advancement] Stage '{prev_stage}': {perf['success_rate']:.1%} success "
+         f"after only {perf['episodes']} episodes (threshold: {self.EARLY_ADVANCEMENT_THRESHOLD:.1%})"
+     )
+ if perf.get("trend_bonus", False):
+     logger.info(
+         f"[Trend Bonus] Stage '{prev_stage}': Strong improvement trend ({perf['trend']:+.2f}) "
+         f"with {perf['success_rate']:.1%} success, allowing advancement"
+     )
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Clean Console Output
No more spam of "Recording episode for stage: ..." messages in console. These now go through the logger at DEBUG level.

### Single Advancement Messages
Each advancement criterion will now log exactly once:

**Before** (duplicate):
```
[INFO] [Early Advancement] Stage 'simplest': 100.0% success after only 30 episodes (threshold: 90.0%)
[INFO] [Early Advancement] Stage 'simplest': 100.0% success after only 30 episodes (threshold: 90.0%)
[INFO] ✨ CURRICULUM ADVANCEMENT! ✨
```

**After** (single):
```
[INFO] [Early Advancement] Stage 'simplest': 100.0% success after only 30 episodes (threshold: 90.0%)
[INFO] ======================================================================
[INFO] ✨ CURRICULUM ADVANCEMENT! ✨
[INFO] ======================================================================
```

### Correct Stage Attribution
Episodes will continue to be correctly attributed to the stage they started on (not the stage they finished on).

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the fixes work correctly:

1. **Run a short training session**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/train_and_compare.py \
       --experiment-name "curriculum_test" \
       --architectures mlp_baseline \
       --train-dataset ../nclone/datasets/train \
       --test-dataset ../nclone/datasets/test \
       --total-timesteps 50000 \
       --num-envs 1 \
       --use-curriculum
   ```

2. **Check for issues**:
   - ✅ No "Recording episode..." spam in console
   - ✅ Single "[Early Advancement]" message per advancement
   - ✅ Single "[Trend Bonus]" message per advancement (if applicable)
   - ✅ Clear advancement summary after criteria messages

3. **Expected output pattern**:
   ```
   [INFO] [Early Advancement] Stage 'simplest': 100.0% success after only 30 episodes (threshold: 90.0%)
   [INFO] ======================================================================
   [INFO] ✨ CURRICULUM ADVANCEMENT! ✨
   [INFO] ======================================================================
   [INFO] Previous stage: simplest
   [INFO] New stage: simpler
   [INFO] Reason: Early Advancement (High Performance)
   [INFO] 
   [INFO] Performance Summary:
   [INFO]   Success rate: 100.0%
   [INFO]   Episodes completed: 30
   [INFO]   Threshold: 70.0%
   [INFO]   Min episodes: 100
   [INFO]   Performance trend: +0.00
   [INFO]   Final mixing ratio: 20.0%
   [INFO] ======================================================================
   ```

- Stage synchronization (working correctly)

## Performance Impact

- **Zero performance impact** - only logging changes
- **No algorithmic changes** - curriculum logic unchanged
