# Graph Representations for Physics-Based Platformer Games

Graph neural networks applied to 2D platformer games require sophisticated techniques to bridge continuous physics with discrete graph structures while preserving the rich movement dynamics that define platformer gameplay. **Recent research reveals that successful approaches combine mathematical physics modeling with hierarchical graph architectures**, achieving both computational efficiency and movement accuracy through careful discretization strategies and state-aware representations.

The challenge extends beyond simple pathfinding to encompass complex state dependencies, momentum-based mechanics, and conditional traversability that make platformers uniquely demanding for graph-based AI systems. Current implementations demonstrate that **pre-computed platform graphs with physics-validated edges can achieve real-time performance** while maintaining the precision needed for jump arcs, wall interactions, and momentum conservation.

## Continuous physics meets discrete graphs through mathematical precision

The fundamental challenge of representing continuous physics-based movement in discrete graph structures has found elegant solutions through **dynamic jump arc calculation using quadratic trajectory equations**. Rather than relying on framerate-dependent physics integration, advanced implementations calculate exact parabolic trajectories using the equation y = ax² + bx + c, solving for gravity and initial velocity coefficients based on known start and end points.

This mathematical approach eliminates timing inconsistencies while preserving realistic physics behavior. The **Surfacer framework for Godot exemplifies this strategy**, pre-parsing entire levels into platform graphs where nodes represent surface points and edges encode complete movement trajectories including walking, climbing, and jumping on floors, walls, and ceilings. Each edge contains not just connectivity information but complete physics validation ensuring the movement is possible given character constraints.

**Momentum integration requires augmented node representations** that extend beyond simple (x, y) coordinates to include velocity state (x, y, velocity_x, velocity_y). This allows graph structures to capture momentum-dependent mechanics like wall-jumping thresholds and trajectory prediction. Research in physics-informed neural networks suggests encoding energy states, contact status, and constraint satisfaction directly into node and edge features, enabling GNNs to reason about physics validity during graph traversal.

State-dependent edge representations handle complex movement mechanics through **conditional activation based on momentum thresholds, height requirements, and sequential dependencies**. Wall-jump edges only become available above minimum horizontal velocity, while certain platform connections require specific fall distances or jump heights. This creates dynamic graph topologies that adapt to current player physics state.

## Conditional traversability through hierarchical state management

Managing conditional traversability in platformer graphs—from locked doors and switches to trap doors and one-way platforms—demands sophisticated state management architectures. **Inventory-aware pathfinding expands 2D positional graphs to multi-dimensional state spaces** where each key or switch combination creates distinct graph layers connected through item-triggered transitions.

The most effective approach treats keys as **portal mechanisms between different world states**, converting factorial complexity into exponential improvement through careful state duplication. Each game configuration (locked/unlocked door combinations) becomes a separate graph layer, with pathfinding algorithms navigating both spatial connections within layers and state transitions between layers.

Dynamic obstacles and hazards require **real-time graph updates** that can enable or disable edges based on moving platforms, timed switches, or environmental changes. The Unity A* Pathfinding Project's DynamicObstacle components demonstrate practical implementation through collider-triggered graph recalculation, balancing update frequency with computational cost through event-driven updates rather than continuous monitoring.

## Strategic node placement balances accuracy with performance

Node placement strategies for platformer levels must discretize continuous space while preserving movement capabilities, requiring careful balance between graph density and computational efficiency. **Grid-based approaches using tile-aligned positioning** with node radius typically half the grid size provide optimal coverage while maintaining manageable graph sizes.

**Intelligent node reduction techniques** focus computational resources on critical areas by removing "Empty/None" type nodes and emphasizing "Surface," "Hazard," "PassThru," and "Solid" node types. Surface detection algorithms automatically identify valid standing positions above solid tiles, while corner placement ensures navigation around obstacles through strategic node positioning at barrier edges.

The most sophisticated implementations use **adaptive density strategies** with higher node concentration in complex traversal areas and sparse coverage in simple horizontal movement zones. This approach optimizes both pathfinding accuracy and computational performance by allocating graph complexity where gameplay demands precision.

**Entity-specific node adaptation** adjusts graph representations based on character capabilities and collision boundaries. Different characters with varying movement abilities see different graph structures, with edges and nodes appearing or disappearing based on jump height, collision radius, and special movement capabilities like wall-jumping or dashing.

## Edge encoding captures physics constraints and movement costs

Edge weighting and feature encoding for GNNs requires sophisticated representation of movement costs, physics constraints, and success probabilities. **Movement classification systems** categorize edges into distinct types: WalkTo for horizontal traversal, JumpTo for calculated trajectories, FallTo for gravity-based movement, and PassThru for drop-through platform interactions.

**Physics validation through kinematic equations** ensures edge feasibility by calculating time-of-flight, trajectory clearance, and collision boundary interactions. Each edge embeds complete physics calculations including maximum jump distances, energy requirements, and momentum constraints, enabling GNNs to reason about movement validity during graph traversal.

Cost functions integrate multiple factors including **spatial distance, temporal duration, traversal difficulty, and hazard penalties**. Walking connections receive low base costs, jumping increases difficulty multipliers, and hazardous surfaces apply penalty weightings that encourage path planning around dangerous areas while maintaining traversal options.

**Feature encoding for neural networks** captures node properties (position coordinates, type classifications, traversal costs) and edge characteristics (movement type, physics constraints, success probability). Global graph features include connectivity metrics and reachability matrices that provide context for local movement decisions.

## Multi-layer architectures handle complex state dependencies

Complex platformer games benefit from **hierarchical graph neural network architectures** that process information at multiple resolution levels simultaneously. The DiffPool framework provides differentiable graph pooling through soft cluster assignments, enabling end-to-end training of hierarchical representations that capture both local movement decisions and global pathfinding strategies.

**Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT)** address games with multiple entity and relationship types through node- and edge-type dependent parameters. This enables sophisticated attention mechanisms that distinguish between different game elements—platforms, enemies, collectibles, switches—while maintaining unified graph processing capabilities.

**Temporal integration** for games with changing states employs memory-augmented neural networks that track game history and predict future state evolution. Dynamic Graph Neural Networks handle structural changes through RNN-based, CNN-based, or attention-based temporal modeling that captures both immediate movement decisions and long-term strategic planning.

Multi-layer network approaches separate **static geometry layers** from **dynamic constraint layers** and **physics validation layers**, enabling modular processing where base level geometry remains constant while movement possibilities adapt to changing game conditions.

## Reachability graphs enable strategic movement planning

Reachability graphs and movement graphs in platformer games require **pre-computation of valid movement sequences** rather than simple connectivity analysis. Advanced implementations calculate complete action sequences—jump followed by movement followed by landing—as single graph edges that represent complex multi-step maneuvers.

**Hierarchical pathfinding systems like HPA*** divide large maps into clusters with pre-computed inter-cluster connections, reducing search complexity from millions of potential nodes to manageable hierarchical structures. This enables real-time pathfinding performance while maintaining optimal or near-optimal path quality through multi-level refinement.

**Jump Point Search** adaptations for platformers identify critical decision points where movement alternatives exist, focusing computational effort on strategic locations while using cached calculations for straightforward traversal segments. This reduces graph complexity without sacrificing movement options.

Modern approaches integrate **trajectory optimization techniques** from robotics, using direct transcription methods that convert continuous optimization problems into discrete parameter spaces suitable for graph-based planning while maintaining physics accuracy through collocation methods and constraint satisfaction.

## Integration strategies merge spatial graphs with game state information

Combining spatial graphs with game state information for neural networks requires **spatio-temporal architectures** that capture both positional relationships and game evolution simultaneously. Spatial Graph Convolution handles geometric dependencies through graph structure while Temporal Convolution models state progression using dilated causal convolutions.

**Game Description Language (GDL) neural reasoning** provides game-agnostic representation frameworks that convert any rule-based game into graph structures suitable for neural network processing. This enables transfer learning across different games while maintaining logical consistency in rule application and state inference.

**Hybrid CNN-GNN architectures** combine convolutional processing for spatial analysis with graph convolution for relationship modeling, particularly effective in games with both spatial grids and complex entity interactions. This dual approach captures both local spatial patterns and global strategic relationships through unified neural architectures.

## Neural approaches show promise for platformer pathfinding

Papers and implementations using GNNs for platformer pathfinding demonstrate significant potential despite limited current research. **Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) approaches** show strong generalization on pathfinding problems through iterative neural networks that learn traditional algorithms like BFS and DFS while maintaining robustness to unseen environments through adversarial training.

**Graph Neural Networks with attention mechanisms** achieve 100% accuracy on shortest path problems while providing more expressive power than traditional graph algorithms through path-based node representation updates. Recent research in multi-robot pathfinding using GNN architectures suggests promising directions for multi-agent platformer scenarios.

**Physics-informed neural network approaches** integrate physics constraints directly into loss functions, penalizing violations of conservation laws while enabling neural networks to learn realistic movement patterns. This combination of data-driven learning with physics constraints shows potential for more robust and generalizable platformer AI systems.

## Dynamic obstacles demand real-time graph adaptation

Handling dynamic obstacles and hazards requires **event-driven graph update systems** that balance responsiveness with computational efficiency. Moving platforms, rotating obstacles, and timed hazards create temporal dependencies that traditional static graphs cannot capture effectively.

**Temporal edge availability windows** represent the most sophisticated approach, encoding not just spatial connectivity but time-dependent traversal opportunities. This enables pathfinding through moving platform sequences and timed obstacle navigation while maintaining computational tractability through careful temporal discretization.

**Dynamic constraint propagation** systems update graph connectivity in real-time as environmental conditions change, using efficient data structures that minimize recalculation overhead while maintaining path validity. Priority-based update systems focus computational resources on graph regions most likely to affect current pathfinding decisions.

## Physics constraint integration ensures realistic movement

Best practices for encoding player physics constraints require **comprehensive integration of collision radius, jump arcs, and wall interactions** directly into graph edge representations. Each edge embeds complete physics calculations including trajectory clearance analysis, energy conservation requirements, and contact state transitions.

**Collision boundary integration** accounts for character dimensions throughout movement execution, ensuring that calculated paths remain valid for entities with non-point collision shapes. This includes bent horizontal line positioning for slope navigation and trajectory clearance analysis for aerial movements.

**Multi-state physics encoding** captures the full range of platformer movement states—ground contact, wall contact, airborne—with appropriate transition dynamics and constraint enforcement. This enables graph representations that maintain physics accuracy while supporting complex movement chains that define advanced platformer gameplay.

## Conclusion
