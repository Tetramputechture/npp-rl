# Post-Graph Implementation Plan: Remaining Tasks for 100% Completion

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of all remaining tasks required to achieve 100% completion of the N++ Deep Reinforcement Learning project as outlined in `full_plan.md`. Following the successful implementation of most graph-based components detailed in `graph_plan.md`, this plan identifies specific gaps in implementation, testing, and documentation that must be addressed to create a production-ready RL agent capable of training on human replays and procedurally generated levels.

The analysis reveals that while significant progress has been made on graph neural network architectures and physics-informed representations, critical gaps remain in:
1. **Human replay processing and imitation learning infrastructure**
2. **Hierarchical reinforcement learning implementation**
3. **Procedural content generation for training data**
4. **Complete integration testing and validation**
5. **Production-ready training pipelines**
