## Remaining Work üìã

### 1. Vision-Free Architecture Analysis
- **Status**: üî∂ PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- **Remaining**:
  - [ ] Train vision-free architectures on actual levels
  - [ ] Compare performance: full_vision vs no_global_view vs vision_free
  - [ ] Document performance/efficiency trade-offs
  - [ ] Select optimal configuration

**Note**: Architecture framework is complete and supports all vision ablation variants. Only actual training experiments remain.

### 2. Training Set Preparation
- **Status**: ‚è≥ BLOCKED - AWAITING TRAINING LEVELS
- **Required**:
  - Curated set of N++ levels for training
  - Balanced across difficulty and categories
  - Sufficient for architecture comparison (~100-200 levels)

**Current Status**: Mock data is used in benchmarking. Need actual training levels to proceed with performance testing.

### 3. Full Architecture Comparison
- **Status**: ‚è≥ NEEDS TRAINING
- **Required**:
  - [ ] Train all architecture variants (GCN, GAT, SimplifiedHGT, full HGT, vision variants)
  - [ ] Evaluate on standardized test suite
  - [ ] Measure convergence speed, final performance, generalization
  - [ ] Apply decision matrix (Performance 40%, Efficiency 30%, Training Speed 20%, Generalization 10%)
  - [ ] Select optimal architecture

### 4. Documentation
- **Status**: üî∂ IN PROGRESS
- **Completed**:
  - [x] CODE_REVIEW_TASK_3_1.md - comprehensive code review
  - [x] This status document
- **Remaining**:
  - [ ] Update PHASE_3_ROBUSTNESS_OPTIMIZATION.md with completion status
  - [ ] Architecture comparison results document (after training)
  - [ ] Vision ablation study results (after training)

## Acceptance Criteria Status

## Architecture Performance Summary (Preliminary - Mock Data)

| Architecture    | Time (ms) | Params  | Memory (MB) | Modalities                          |
|-----------------|-----------|---------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| simplified_hgt  | 6.62      | 3.0M    | 11.55       | temporal,global,graph,state,reach   |
| gat             | 9.65      | 9.7M    | 36.82       | temporal,global,graph,state,reach   |
| gcn             | 17.59     | 3.1M    | 11.97       | temporal,global,graph,state,reach   |

**Note**: These are benchmarking results on mock data. Actual performance will be determined after training on real levels.

## Integration Notes

- All new code follows NPP-RL guidelines (file size limits, import structure, documentation)
- Type hints compatible with Python 3.8+
- No unused imports
- Comprehensive docstrings with research references
- Performance warnings added where applicable
- Backward compatibility maintained

## Research Foundation

The implementation is informed by:
- Kipf & Welling (2017): "Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks" (GCN)
- Veliƒçkoviƒá et al. (2018): "Graph Attention Networks" (GAT)

## Questions for User

1. **Training Levels**: Do you have a curated set of training levels, or should we create a script to generate/select them?
2. **Training Resources**: What compute resources are available for architecture comparison experiments?
3. **Vision Priority**: Should we prioritize vision-free analysis, or compare all GNN architectures first?
4. **Decision Criteria**: Are the default weights (Performance 40%, Efficiency 30%, Training 20%, Generalization 10%) acceptable?
