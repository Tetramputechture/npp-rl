## Executive Summary

This document breaks down the high-level graph neural network concepts from `graph_plan.md` into concrete, actionable implementation tasks for the N++ reinforcement learning project. The tasks are organized by complexity and dependency, providing a roadmap for integrating advanced graph-based techniques into our existing PPO training pipeline.

**Current State**: We have a basic GraphSAGE implementation in `npp_rl/models/gnn.py` and a sophisticated graph builder in `nclone` with sub-grid resolution and physics-aware traversability.

**Goal**: Enhance the graph representation and processing capabilities to enable more sophisticated spatial reasoning, physics-aware pathfinding, and hierarchical decision making.

## Architecture Overview

Our enhanced graph neural network architecture will consist of three main components:
