# NPP-RL Development Tasks

This directory contains detailed task documentation for the NPP-RL project development phases. Each phase builds upon the previous one to create a robust, completion-focused reinforcement learning agent for the N++ game.

## Phase Overview

### Phase 1: Completion-Focused Foundation (2-3 weeks) - **CRITICAL**
**Status**: Ready to start  
**File**: [PHASE_1_COMPLETION_FOCUSED_FOUNDATION.md](PHASE_1_COMPLETION_FOCUSED_FOUNDATION.md)

Establishes the foundation by simplifying the system to focus solely on level completion without gold collection. Removes unnecessary complexity and integrates the existing completion planner with RL training.

**Key deliverables**:
- Gold collection system completely removed
- Entity processing simplified to 4 types (tile, ninja, mine, objective)
- Completion-focused reward system (+0.1 switch, +1.0 exit)
- Hierarchical controller integrated with PPO training
- Single-switch levels completed with >80% success rate

### Phase 2: Hierarchical Control (3-4 weeks) - **CRITICAL**
**Status**: Depends on Phase 1  
**File**: [PHASE_2_HIERARCHICAL_CONTROL.md](PHASE_2_HIERARCHICAL_CONTROL.md)

Implements sophisticated two-level hierarchical RL architecture with ICM-enhanced exploration for physics-uncertain environments. Handles complex multi-switch levels with mine avoidance.

**Key deliverables**:
- Two-level policy architecture (high-level subtask selection, low-level action execution)
- Subtask-specific dense reward functions
- Mine avoidance integrated with hierarchical navigation
- Training stability across both policy levels
- Multi-switch levels completed with >60% success rate

### Phase 3: Robustness & Optimization (2-3 weeks) - **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Status**: Depends on Phase 2  
**File**: [PHASE_3_ROBUSTNESS_OPTIMIZATION.md](PHASE_3_ROBUSTNESS_OPTIMIZATION.md)

Optimizes the system for robustness and performance across diverse level types. Establishes comprehensive evaluation and achieves production-ready performance.

**Key deliverables**:
- Model architecture optimized for efficiency (<10ms inference)
- Advanced ICM integration with reachability-modulated curiosity
- Comprehensive evaluation framework across level complexity spectrum
- Hardware optimization for H100 GPUs (>50% training speedup)
- Robust performance: >70% success rate across all level categories

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (2-4 weeks) - **OPTIONAL**
**Status**: Depends on Phase 3  
**File**: [PHASE_4_ADVANCED_FEATURES.md](PHASE_4_ADVANCED_FEATURES.md)

Optional enhancements that push performance to human-level efficiency. Includes human replay integration, advanced architectures, and curriculum learning.

**Key deliverables**:
- Human replay integration for behavioral cloning pre-training
- Advanced model architecture evaluation and potential upgrade
- Curriculum learning for progressive difficulty training
- Advanced exploration strategies beyond ICM
- Human-level performance efficiency

## Task Structure

Each phase document contains:

### Task Breakdown
- **What we want to do**: Clear objective statement
- **Current state**: Assessment of existing implementation
- **Files to create/modify**: Specific file-level changes needed
- **Detailed implementation**: Technical specifications and code examples
- **Acceptance criteria**: Measurable success conditions
- **Testing requirements**: Validation and verification needs

### Dependencies and Prerequisites
- Phase dependencies and completion requirements
- External system dependencies
- Hardware and data requirements

### Risk Mitigation
- Technical risks and mitigation strategies
- Fallback plans for critical components
- Performance and stability considerations

### Success Criteria
- Primary objectives and deliverables
- Performance targets and metrics
- Quality gates and review requirements

## Development Guidelines

### Critical Path
**Phases 1-2 are critical** for a functional completion agent:
- Phase 1 establishes the simplified, completion-focused foundation
- Phase 2 implements hierarchical control for complex levels
- Phase 3 optimizes for production readiness
- Phase 4 adds advanced features for research-level performance

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Complete phases sequentially** - each phase builds on the previous
2. **Validate thoroughly** - comprehensive testing at each phase
3. **Maintain simplicity** - avoid overengineering, especially in early phases
4. **Focus on completion** - gold collection and complex hazards deferred

### Performance Targets
- **Phase 1**: >80% success on single-switch levels
- **Phase 2**: >60% success on multi-switch levels  
- **Phase 3**: >70% success across all level types
- **Phase 4**: Human-level efficiency metrics

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Simplified Scope (Based on Updated Constraints)
- **No gold collection**: Focus purely on switch â†’ exit completion
- **Mine hazards only**: No thwumps or drones in first iteration
- **Physics uncertainty**: Rely on ICM exploration, not deterministic pathfinding
- **Reachability-based**: Use flood fill analysis for strategic decisions

### Hierarchical Architecture
- **High-level policy**: Subtask selection based on 8D reachability features
- **Low-level policy**: Action execution with ICM-enhanced exploration
- **Completion planner integration**: Use existing heuristic for strategic guidance

### Technical Stack
- **Environment**: nclone with switch-aware reachability analysis and hierarchical RL integration
- **RL Framework**: PPO with hierarchical extensions
- **Feature Extraction**: Multimodal fusion (CNN + GNN + MLP)
- **Exploration**: ICM with reachability modulation
- **Hardware**: Optimized for H100 GPUs

### Repository Architecture (Updated)
- **nclone**: Environment implementation, completion planner, hierarchical mixins
- **npp-rl**: RL algorithms, training scripts, hierarchical controllers, feature extractors

## Getting Started

1. **Review the consolidated analysis**: [../consolidated_codebase_analysis_report.md](../consolidated_codebase_analysis_report.md)
2. **Start with Phase 1**: Begin with foundation tasks
3. **Follow task order**: Complete tasks within each phase sequentially
4. **Test thoroughly**: Validate each component before proceeding
5. **Document progress**: Update task status and performance metrics

## Estimated Timeline

- **Minimum viable agent**: 5-7 weeks (Phases 1-2)
- **Production-ready agent**: 7-10 weeks (Phases 1-3)
- **Research-level agent**: 9-14 weeks (Phases 1-4)

The simplified scope significantly reduces complexity while maintaining sophisticated RL capabilities where they provide clear benefit for the physics-uncertain, completion-focused problem.
