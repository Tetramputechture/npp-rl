# Phase 4: Advanced Features (Optional)

**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks  
**Priority**: Medium (Optional Enhancement)  
**Dependencies**: Phase 3 completed  

## Overview

This phase implements advanced features that enhance the agent's capabilities beyond the core completion-focused functionality. These features are optional enhancements that can significantly improve performance but are not required for a functional completion agent. The focus is on human replay integration, advanced model architectures, and curriculum learning.

## Objectives

1. Integrate human replay data for behavioral cloning pre-training
2. Evaluate and potentially upgrade to more sophisticated model architectures
3. Implement curriculum learning for progressive difficulty training
4. Enhance exploration strategies with advanced techniques
5. Achieve human-level performance efficiency

## Task Breakdown

### Task 4.1: Human Replay Integration (2-3 weeks)

**What we want to do**: Process human replay data to extract completion-focused behavioral patterns and integrate them into the training pipeline through behavioral cloning pre-training.

**Current state**:
- Raw human replay data exists in `datasets/` directory
- Basic BC script (`bc_pretrain.py`) exists but incomplete
- No systematic replay processing pipeline
- No integration with hierarchical training system

**Files to create/modify**:
- `tools/replay_processor.py` (new)
- `npp_rl/datasets/replay_dataset.py` (new)
- `npp_rl/training/behavioral_cloning.py` (new)
- `npp_rl/training/hybrid_trainer.py` (new)
- `bc_pretrain.py` (enhance existing)

**Human replay processing requirements**:

#### Replay Data Processing Pipeline
**Data extraction from replays**:
```python
class ReplayProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.completion_extractor = CompletionSequenceExtractor()
        self.state_action_extractor = StateActionExtractor()
        self.quality_filter = ReplayQualityFilter()
    
    def process_replay_file(self, replay_path):
        """Process a single replay file into training data."""
        replay_data = self.load_replay(replay_path)
        
        # Extract completion sequence
        completion_sequence = self.completion_extractor.extract(replay_data)
        
        # Filter for quality (successful completion, reasonable efficiency)
        if not self.quality_filter.is_high_quality(completion_sequence):
            return None
        
        # Extract state-action pairs
        state_action_pairs = self.state_action_extractor.extract(
            replay_data, completion_sequence
        )
        
        return {
            'level_id': replay_data['level_id'],
            'completion_time': completion_sequence['completion_time'],
            'switch_sequence': completion_sequence['switch_sequence'],
            'state_action_pairs': state_action_pairs,
            'efficiency_score': self.calculate_efficiency(completion_sequence)
        }
```

**Quality filtering criteria**:
- Successful level completion
- Reasonable efficiency (within 2x optimal steps)
- No excessive deaths or restarts
- Clear switch activation sequence
- Minimal idle time or repetitive behaviors

**State-action extraction**:
```python
class StateActionExtractor:
    def __init__(self, feature_extractor):
        self.feature_extractor = feature_extractor
        self.subtask_classifier = SubtaskClassifier()
    
    def extract(self, replay_data, completion_sequence):
        """Extract state-action pairs with subtask labels."""
        state_action_pairs = []
        
        for frame in replay_data['frames']:
            # Extract state features using same pipeline as RL training
            state_features = self.feature_extractor.extract_features(frame)
            
            # Extract action
            action = self.extract_action(frame)
            
            # Classify current subtask based on game state and objectives
            current_subtask = self.subtask_classifier.classify(
                frame, completion_sequence
            )
            
            state_action_pairs.append({
                'state': state_features,
                'action': action,
                'subtask': current_subtask,
                'timestamp': frame['timestamp']
            })
        
        return state_action_pairs
```

#### Behavioral Cloning Implementation
**Hierarchical BC training**:
```python
class HierarchicalBehavioralCloning:
    def __init__(self, hierarchical_model):
        self.model = hierarchical_model
        self.high_level_criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
        self.low_level_criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
        self.optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(self.model.parameters(), lr=1e-4)
    
    def train_step(self, batch):
        """Train both high-level and low-level policies on human data."""
        states = batch['states']
        actions = batch['actions']
        subtasks = batch['subtasks']
        
        # High-level policy training (subtask prediction)
        predicted_subtasks = self.model.high_level_policy(states)
        high_level_loss = self.high_level_criterion(predicted_subtasks, subtasks)
        
        # Low-level policy training (action prediction given subtask)
        predicted_actions = self.model.low_level_policy(states, subtasks)
        low_level_loss = self.low_level_criterion(predicted_actions, actions)
        
        # Combined loss
        total_loss = high_level_loss + low_level_loss
        
        self.optimizer.zero_grad()
        total_loss.backward()
        self.optimizer.step()
        
        return {
            'total_loss': total_loss.item(),
            'high_level_loss': high_level_loss.item(),
            'low_level_loss': low_level_loss.item()
        }
```

**Data augmentation for BC**:
- Temporal augmentation: Extract subsequences from successful runs
- State augmentation: Minor position/velocity perturbations
- Action smoothing: Handle noisy human inputs
- Subtask balancing: Ensure balanced representation of all subtasks

#### Hybrid IL+RL Training
**Training pipeline integration**:
```python

    def __init__(self, hierarchical_model, bc_dataset, rl_environment):
        self.model = hierarchical_model
        self.bc_trainer = HierarchicalBehavioralCloning(hierarchical_model)
        self.rl_trainer = HierarchicalPPO(hierarchical_model)
        self.bc_dataset = bc_dataset
        self.rl_environment = rl_environment
    
    def train(self, total_steps):
        """Hybrid training with BC pre-training followed by RL fine-tuning."""
        
        # Phase 1: BC pre-training (20% of total steps)
        bc_steps = int(0.2 * total_steps)
        self.bc_pretrain(bc_steps)
        
        # Phase 2: Hybrid BC+RL training (30% of total steps)
        hybrid_steps = int(0.3 * total_steps)
        self.hybrid_train(hybrid_steps)
        
        # Phase 3: Pure RL training (50% of total steps)
        rl_steps = int(0.5 * total_steps)
        self.rl_finetune(rl_steps)
    
    def bc_pretrain(self, steps):
        """Pure behavioral cloning pre-training."""
        for step in range(steps):
            batch = self.bc_dataset.sample_batch()
            loss_info = self.bc_trainer.train_step(batch)
            
            if step % 100 == 0:
                self.evaluate_bc_performance()
    
    def hybrid_train(self, steps):
        """Mixed BC and RL training."""
        for step in range(steps):
            # Alternate between BC and RL updates
            if step % 2 == 0:
                bc_batch = self.bc_dataset.sample_batch()
                self.bc_trainer.train_step(bc_batch)
            else:
                rl_batch = self.collect_rl_experience()
                self.rl_trainer.train_step(rl_batch)
```

            for _ in range(3)  # Reduced from 6 layers
        ])
    
    def forward(self, graph_data):
        # Efficient HGT processing focused on completion task
        node_embeddings = self.embed_nodes(graph_data)
        
        for layer in self.hgt_layers:
            node_embeddings = layer(node_embeddings, graph_data.edge_index)

            results[arch_name] = arch_results
        
        return self.analyze_results(results)
```

                current_performance=current_performance
            )
            
            # Train on selected levels
            self.base_trainer.train_on_levels(
                training_levels, 
                steps=evaluation_interval
            )
            
            # Log curriculum progress
            self.log_curriculum_progress(current_performance, training_levels)
    
    def evaluate_current_performance(self):
        """Evaluate agent on representative test set."""
        test_levels = self.curriculum_manager.get_evaluation_levels()
        results = self.base_trainer.evaluate(test_levels)
        
        return {
            'success_rate': results['success_rate'],

4. **Multi-task curriculum**: Balance different skill requirements

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Difficulty assessment system accurately categorizes levels
- [ ] Curriculum manager adapts difficulty based on performance
- [ ] Training with curriculum shows improved generalization
- [ ] Performance on hard levels improves compared to random training
- [ ] Curriculum progression is smooth and stable
- [ ] Final performance competitive with or better than non-curriculum baseline

**Testing requirements**:

### Task 4.4: Advanced Exploration Strategies (Optional - 1 week)

**What we want to do**: Implement advanced exploration techniques beyond ICM to further improve exploration efficiency in complex levels.

**Current state**:
- ICM with reachability modulation from Phase 3
- No additional exploration strategies
- Exploration efficiency could be improved for very complex levels

**Files to create/modify**:
- `npp_rl/intrinsic/advanced_exploration.py` (new)
- `npp_rl/intrinsic/count_based_exploration.py` (new)
- `npp_rl/intrinsic/ensemble_exploration.py` (new)

**Advanced exploration techniques**:

#### Count-Based Exploration
**Pseudo-count exploration**:
```python
class PseudoCountExploration:
    def __init__(self, state_encoder):
        self.state_encoder = state_encoder
        self.state_counts = {}
        self.density_model = DensityModel()
    
    def calculate_exploration_bonus(self, state):
        """Calculate exploration bonus based on state visitation count."""
        encoded_state = self.state_encoder.encode(state)
        
        # Estimate pseudo-count using density model
        density = self.density_model.predict_density(encoded_state)
        pseudo_count = self.density_to_count(density)
        
        # Exploration bonus inversely proportional to count
        exploration_bonus = 1.0 / (pseudo_count + 1.0)
        
        return exploration_bonus
    
    def update_counts(self, state):
        """Update state visitation statistics."""
        encoded_state = self.state_encoder.encode(state)
        self.density_model.update(encoded_state)
```

#### Ensemble-Based Exploration
**Uncertainty estimation through ensemble disagreement**:
```python
class EnsembleExploration:
    def __init__(self, num_models=5):
        self.ensemble = [ForwardModel() for _ in range(num_models)]
        self.num_models = num_models
    
    def calculate_uncertainty_bonus(self, state, action):
        """Calculate exploration bonus based on model disagreement."""
        predictions = []
        
        for model in self.ensemble:
            prediction = model.predict(state, action)
            predictions.append(prediction)
        
        # Calculate disagreement (variance) among predictions
        predictions = torch.stack(predictions)
        uncertainty = torch.var(predictions, dim=0).mean()
        
        return uncertainty.item()
    
    def update_ensemble(self, state, action, next_state):
        """Update all models in ensemble."""
        for model in self.ensemble:
            model.update(state, action, next_state)
```

#### Multi-Objective Exploration
**Combine multiple exploration signals**:
```python
class MultiObjectiveExploration:
    def __init__(self):
        self.icm = ICMExploration()
        self.count_based = PseudoCountExploration()
        self.ensemble = EnsembleExploration()
        
        # Learned weights for combining exploration signals
        self.combination_weights = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(3))
    
    def calculate_combined_bonus(self, state, action, next_state):
        """Combine multiple exploration bonuses."""
        icm_bonus = self.icm.calculate_curiosity_reward(state, action, next_state)
        count_bonus = self.count_based.calculate_exploration_bonus(state)
        uncertainty_bonus = self.ensemble.calculate_uncertainty_bonus(state, action)
        
        # Weighted combination with learned weights
        weights = torch.softmax(self.combination_weights, dim=0)
        
        combined_bonus = (
            weights[0] * icm_bonus +
            weights[1] * count_bonus +
            weights[2] * uncertainty_bonus
        )
        
        return combined_bonus
```
