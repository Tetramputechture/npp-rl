# ICM Standalone Usage Guide
## Using Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM) Independent of Hierarchical PPO

### Overview

**Good news!** You can now use ICM with standard PPO - no hierarchical architecture required!

This guide shows you how to enable curiosity-driven exploration without the complexity of hierarchical PPO.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Enable ICM in Your Config

```json
{
  "experiment_name": "mlp-with-icm",
  "architectures": ["mlp_baseline"],
  
  "enable_icm": true,
  "icm_config": {
    "eta": 0.01,
    "alpha": 0.1
  }
}
```

That's it! Two lines and you have intrinsic rewards.

### 2. Run Training

```bash
python -m npp_rl.training.train \
    --config configs/mlp_with_icm_example.json \
    --total-timesteps 2000000
```

### 3. Monitor ICM Metrics

Open TensorBoard:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir experiments/mlp-with-icm/
```

Look for these metrics:
- `intrinsic/reward_mean` - Should be > 0.05
- `intrinsic/reward_contribution` - Should be 5-15%
- `icm/forward_loss` - Should be stable or decreasing

---

## Configuration Options

### Complete ICM Config

```json
{
  "enable_icm": true,
  "icm_config": {
    // === Core Parameters ===
    "feature_dim": 512,        // Feature size (match your extractor)
    "action_dim": 6,           // Number of actions
    "hidden_dim": 256,         // ICM network hidden size
    
    // === Reward Scaling ===
    "eta": 0.01,              // Intrinsic reward scale (IMPORTANT!)
    "alpha": 0.1,             // Intrinsic weight (10% intrinsic, 90% extrinsic)
    
    // === ICM Training ===
    "lambda_inv": 0.1,        // Inverse model loss weight
    "lambda_fwd": 0.9,        // Forward model loss weight
    "learning_rate": 0.0001,  // ICM optimizer learning rate
    
    // === Advanced Features ===
    "enable_mine_awareness": true,   // Use mine-aware curiosity
    "r_int_clip": 1.0,              // Clip intrinsic rewards
    "update_frequency": 4,           // Update ICM every N steps
    "buffer_size": 10000,            // Experience buffer size
    "debug": false                   // Enable debug logging
  }
}
```

### Key Parameters Explained

#### **eta** (Intrinsic Reward Scale)
```
Controls how strong intrinsic rewards are relative to extrinsic rewards.

Low (0.005):  Weak exploration, good for dense rewards
Medium (0.01): Balanced (RECOMMENDED for N++)
High (0.02):   Strong exploration, good for sparse rewards

Example:
eta = 0.01 means ICM prediction error is scaled by 0.01 before adding to reward.
```

#### **alpha** (Intrinsic Weight)
```
Controls how much of total reward comes from intrinsic vs extrinsic.

total_reward = (1-alpha) * extrinsic + alpha * intrinsic

Low (0.05):    5% intrinsic, 95% extrinsic (conservative)
Medium (0.1):  10% intrinsic, 90% extrinsic (RECOMMENDED)
High (0.2):    20% intrinsic, 80% extrinsic (aggressive)

Example:
alpha = 0.1 means intrinsic rewards contribute 10% of total reward.
```

#### **enable_mine_awareness**
```
Your unique feature! Modulates curiosity based on danger.

When enabled:
- Reduces curiosity near mines (don't encourage reckless exploration)
- Increases curiosity in safe areas
- Boosts exploration of newly accessible areas (frontiers)
- Prioritizes areas near objectives (switches, exits)

ALWAYS set to true for N++!
```

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Sparse Reward Problem (Your Current Issue)

**Problem:**
- Few rewards (only on completion/death)
- Agent doesn't know what to do
- High NOOP percentage (17.66%)

**Solution:**
```json
{
  "enable_icm": true,
  "icm_config": {
    "eta": 0.015,        // Slightly higher for stronger exploration
    "alpha": 0.12,       // More intrinsic weight
    "enable_mine_awareness": true
  }
}
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Dense rewards from visiting new areas
- Lower NOOP (movement is rewarding)
- Better exploration
- +10-15% success rate

### Scenario 2: Maze Navigation

**Problem:**
- Agent fails at maze:tiny (8.3% success)
- Doesn't explore systematically
- Gets stuck in dead ends

**Solution:**
```json
{
  "enable_icm": true,
  "icm_config": {
    "eta": 0.015,
    "alpha": 0.12,
    "buffer_size": 20000,  // Larger buffer for complex state space
    "enable_mine_awareness": true
  }
}
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Exploring dead ends gives intrinsic reward
- Agent learns maze structure through curiosity
- +15-20% maze success rate

### Scenario 3: Conservative Exploration (With Good Extrinsic Rewards)

**Problem:**
- You've fixed reward structure (positive rewards)
- Don't want ICM to dominate
- Just want gentle exploration boost

**Solution:**
```json
{
  "enable_icm": true,
  "icm_config": {
    "eta": 0.005,        // Lower scale
    "alpha": 0.05,       // Only 5% intrinsic
    "enable_mine_awareness": true
  }
}
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Slight exploration boost
- Doesn't interfere with extrinsic learning
- Safe addition

## Combining ICM with Priority 1 Fixes

### Recommended Approach: Fix Rewards First, Then Add ICM

**Phase 1: Fix Extrinsic Rewards (Week 1)**
```json
{
  "enable_icm": false,  // Not yet
  // ... reward structure fixes ...
}
```

**Phase 2: Add ICM (Week 1-2)**
```json
{
  "enable_icm": true,
  "icm_config": {
    "eta": 0.01,
    "alpha": 0.1
  }
}
```

**Why this order?**
1. Fixes reward structure (makes extrinsic rewards positive)
2. Adds ICM on top (dense intrinsic rewards)
3. Result: Both extrinsic and intrinsic helping!

### Alternative: Use ICM to Offset Bad Rewards (Quick Test)

**If you want to test ICM immediately without fixing rewards:**

```json
{
  "enable_icm": true,
  "icm_config": {
    "eta": 0.02,         // Higher to compensate for negative extrinsic
    "alpha": 0.15,       // More intrinsic weight
    "enable_mine_awareness": true
  }
}
```

**Expected:**
- Intrinsic rewards may offset some negative extrinsic
- Won't fully solve problem, but should show improvement
- Use this to verify ICM works, then do full reward fix

---

## Tuning ICM

### Step 1: Run with Defaults

Start with recommended settings:
```json
{
  "eta": 0.01,
  "alpha": 0.1,
  "enable_mine_awareness": true
}
```

Run for 500K timesteps.

### Step 2: Check Metrics

In TensorBoard, look at:

**Good signs:**
- ✅ `intrinsic/reward_mean` > 0.05
- ✅ `intrinsic/reward_contribution` = 5-15%
- ✅ `icm/forward_loss` decreasing or stable
- ✅ `actions/frequency/NOOP` decreasing
- ✅ Success rate improving

**Bad signs:**
- ❌ `intrinsic/reward_mean` < 0.01 (too weak)
- ❌ `intrinsic/reward_contribution` > 50% (too strong)
- ❌ `icm/forward_loss` exploding (unstable)
- ❌ Agent dying more (reckless exploration)

### Step 3: Adjust Parameters

**If intrinsic rewards too weak:**
```json
{
  "eta": 0.02,     // Increase from 0.01
  "alpha": 0.15    // Increase from 0.1
}
```

**If intrinsic rewards too strong:**
```json
{
  "eta": 0.005,    // Decrease from 0.01
  "alpha": 0.05,   // Decrease from 0.1
  "r_int_clip": 0.5  // Tighter clipping
}
```

**If agent exploring recklessly:**
```json
{
  "enable_mine_awareness": true,  // Make sure this is ON
  "r_int_clip": 0.5,             // Lower clip
  "eta": 0.008                    // Slightly lower scale
}
```

### Step 4: Re-run and Iterate

Run another 500K-1M timesteps with adjusted parameters.

**Target metrics:**
- Intrinsic contribution: 10-15%
- NOOP percentage: <12%
- Success rate improvement: +10-15%

## ICM vs Hierarchical PPO

### When to Use Each

**Use ICM Standalone (Standard PPO + ICM):**
- ✅ Simpler architecture
- ✅ Faster training
- ✅ Easier to debug
- ✅ Just need exploration boost
- ✅ Good starting point

**Use ICM with Hierarchical PPO:**
- ✅ Need sub-goal decomposition (switch → exit)
- ✅ Want explicit high-level planning
- ✅ Willing to tune more hyperparameters
- ✅ Have time for longer training

**Use Both:**
- ✅ Best of both worlds
- ✅ ICM for exploration
- ✅ Hierarchy for goal structure
- ⚠️ Most complex option
- ⚠️ Most hyperparameters to tune

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Standard PPO | PPO + ICM | Hierarchical PPO | Hierarchical + ICM |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Complexity** | Low | Medium | High | Highest |
| **Training Speed** | Fast | Fast | Slower | Slower |
| **Exploration** | Policy entropy only | Curiosity-driven | Policy entropy | Curiosity-driven |
| **Credit Assignment** | Direct | Direct | Hierarchical | Hierarchical |
| **Hyperparameters** | ~10 | ~15 | ~20 | ~25 |
| **Recommended For** | Dense rewards | Sparse rewards | Complex goals | Hardest problems |

### Recommendation for N++

**Start with: Standard PPO + ICM**

Reasons:
1. Your problem: Sparse rewards (ICM helps)
2. Simpler to debug (fewer moving parts)
3. Faster training (no hierarchical overhead)
4. Can always add hierarchy later if needed

**Upgrade to Hierarchical + ICM if:**
- Success rate plateaus <50% with ICM alone
- Agent struggles with switch → exit sequencing
- You have time for longer training runs

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "ICM not being created"

**Check logs for:**
```
"ICM enabled - creating intrinsic curiosity module..."
"✓ ICM wrapper applied - intrinsic rewards enabled"
```

**If missing:**
- Verify `"enable_icm": true` in config
- Check config is being loaded correctly
- Look for error messages in logs

### Issue 2: "Intrinsic rewards are zero"

**Check TensorBoard:**
```
intrinsic/reward_mean = 0.0
```

**Possible causes:**
1. ICM not initialized
2. Feature extractor not compatible
3. No novel states (unlikely)

**Solutions:**
1. Check ICM is enabled in logs
2. Verify `feature_dim` matches your extractor (512 for MLP)
3. Enable debug mode: `"debug": true`

### Issue 3: "Agent dying more often"

**Cause:** Reckless exploration (ICM too strong)

**Solutions:**
1. **Enable mine awareness:**
```json
"enable_mine_awareness": true
```

2. **Reduce intrinsic weight:**
```json
"alpha": 0.05,  // Down from 0.1
"eta": 0.008    // Down from 0.01
```

3. **Tighter clipping:**
```json
"r_int_clip": 0.5  // Down from 1.0
```

### Issue 4: "ICM dominates learning"

**Symptoms:**
- Intrinsic contribution >50%
- Agent ignores extrinsic rewards
- Random exploration, no goal-directed behavior

**Solutions:**
1. **Reduce intrinsic weight:**
```json
"alpha": 0.05,  // Lower weight
```

2. **Reduce reward scale:**
```json
"eta": 0.005,  // Lower scale
```

3. **Check extrinsic rewards:**
```bash
# Make sure extrinsic rewards are reasonable
# If extrinsic is -40 and intrinsic is +10,
# ICM will dominate by default!
```

### Issue 5: "No improvement with ICM"

**Possible causes:**
1. Extrinsic rewards still too negative (fix rewards first)
2. ICM parameters too conservative
3. Not training long enough

**Solutions:**
1. Fix reward structure (Priority 1 from main analysis)
2. Increase ICM strength:
```json
"eta": 0.015,
"alpha": 0.12
```
3. Train for at least 1M timesteps to see ICM impact

## Integration with Other Systems

### ICM + PBRS (Potential-Based Reward Shaping)

**Both can be used together!**

```json
{
  "enable_pbrs": true,
  "pbrs_gamma": 0.99,
  
  "enable_icm": true,
  "icm_config": {
    "eta": 0.01,
    "alpha": 0.1
  }
}
```

**Result:**
```
total_reward = extrinsic + pbrs + intrinsic

Example:
extrinsic = +0.5    (fixed reward structure)
pbrs      = +0.01   (moving toward switch)
intrinsic = +0.1    (visiting new room)
total     = +0.61   (nice positive feedback!)
```

**Recommended weights:**
```
60% extrinsic (main signal)
30% PBRS (navigation guidance)
10% ICM (exploration bonus)
```

### ICM + Curriculum Learning

**ICM helps curriculum learning!**

```json
{
  "use_curriculum": true,
  "curriculum_threshold": 0.4,
  
  "enable_icm": true,
  "icm_config": {
    "eta": 0.01,
    "alpha": 0.1
  }
}
```

**Why it helps:**
- ICM encourages exploration of new curriculum stages
- Intrinsic rewards help when curriculum difficulty increases
- Better state coverage = faster adaptation

### ICM + Reward Normalization

**Use VecNormalize with ICM:**

The environment factory already applies VecNormalize. This helps ICM by:
- Normalizing reward scale
- Making intrinsic and extrinsic rewards comparable
- Preventing one from dominating

**Already enabled in your setup!**

## Monitoring & Analysis

### TensorBoard Metrics

**ICM-specific:**
```
intrinsic/reward_mean        # Average intrinsic reward per step
intrinsic/reward_std         # Variance in intrinsic rewards
intrinsic/reward_contribution  # % of total reward from ICM

icm/forward_loss             # Forward model prediction error
icm/inverse_loss             # Inverse model prediction error
icm/total_loss               # Combined ICM loss

icm/reachability_modulation  # Reachability awareness impact
icm/frontier_boost_count     # Frontier exploration activations
icm/mine_avoidance_count     # Mine awareness activations
```

**Agent behavior:**
```
actions/frequency/NOOP       # Should decrease with ICM
episode/success_rate         # Should increase with ICM
episode/length              # May increase (more exploration)
```

### Analysis Script

```python
# Check ICM impact
import tensorboard as tb
from tensorboard.backend.event_processing import event_accumulator

ea = event_accumulator.EventAccumulator('experiments/mlp-icm/')
ea.Reload()

# Get intrinsic reward contribution
intrinsic_contrib = ea.Scalars('intrinsic/reward_contribution')
print(f"Intrinsic contribution: {intrinsic_contrib[-1].value:.1%}")

# Check if NOOP decreased
noop_start = ea.Scalars('actions/frequency/NOOP')[0].value
noop_end = ea.Scalars('actions/frequency/NOOP')[-1].value
print(f"NOOP: {noop_start:.1%} → {noop_end:.1%}")

# Check success rate improvement
success_start = ea.Scalars('episode/success_rate_smoothed')[0].value
success_end = ea.Scalars('episode/success_rate_smoothed')[-1].value
print(f"Success: {success_start:.1%} → {success_end:.1%}")
```
