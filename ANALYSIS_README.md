# RL Training Analysis - October 2025

This directory contains a comprehensive analysis of the `mlp-baseline-1026` training run and critical fixes to enable effective learning.

## 🚨 Critical Findings

The current training setup has **three critical issues** that prevent learning:

1. **Reward Scaling Catastrophe:** Time penalty makes level completion worthless (successful runs = negative returns)
2. **Value Function Collapse:** Estimated returns degraded by -6966% 
3. **Curriculum Stagnation:** Agent stuck at stage 2 with 4% success rate (was 14.8% peak)

## 📊 Analysis Results

**Training Status:** ⚠️ FAILED - Agent performance declining over time

**Key Metrics:**
- Curriculum stage: 2/6 (stuck)
- Success rate: 4% (declining from 100%)
- Value estimates: -4.33 mean (collapsed from -0.06)
- Episode returns: Negative even for successful completions!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Busy People (5 minutes)
1. Read: [EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md](EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md)
2. See the problem: Check [analysis_output/curriculum_progression.png](analysis_output/curriculum_progression.png)
3. Understand the fix: Successful completion goes from **-9.0** to **+9.9** (positive!)

### To Implement Fixes (1-2 hours)
1. Read: [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)
2. Apply: Emergency fixes (Tier 1)
3. Test: Run 100k step validation
4. Deploy: Full training with fixed config

### For Deep Dive (2-3 hours)
1. Read: [COMPREHENSIVE_TRAINING_ANALYSIS.md](COMPREHENSIVE_TRAINING_ANALYSIS.md)
2. Review: All visualizations in [analysis_output/](analysis_output/)
3. Run: `python analysis_tensorboard.py` to reproduce analysis
4. Experiment: Try alternative approaches (Section 7 of analysis)

## 🎯 The Fix (In One Image)

```
Current Reward Scaling (BROKEN):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Fast completion (1000 steps):
  +1.0 (completion) - 10.0 (time) = -9.0  ❌
  
Fixed Reward Scaling (WORKING):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Fast completion (1000 steps):
  +10.0 (completion) - 0.1 (time) = +9.9  ✅
```

## 📈 Expected Outcomes After Fixes

| Metric | Current | After Fix | Improvement |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Stage Reached | 2 (stuck) | 4-5 | +2-3 stages |
| Success Rate | 4% | 60%+ | +56 pp |
| Value Mean | -4.33 | [-2, 2] | Stabilized |
| Episode Return (win) | Negative! | +8 to +10 | POSITIVE! |

## 🔍 How to Use These Files

### If you're a researcher:
→ Read [COMPREHENSIVE_TRAINING_ANALYSIS.md](COMPREHENSIVE_TRAINING_ANALYSIS.md) for methodology and references

### If you're implementing the fixes:
→ Follow [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) step by step

### If you're debugging training issues:
→ Run `python analysis_tensorboard.py` on your logs

### If you need quick answers:
→ Read [EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md](EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md) (5 min)

## 🛠️ Tools & Requirements

**To run analysis:**
```bash
pip install tensorboard pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy scipy
python analysis_tensorboard.py
```

**To validate fixes:**
```bash
python REWARD_CONSTANTS_FIXED.py
# Should show all scenarios as ✓
```

## 📊 Key Visualizations

All plots available in [analysis_output/](analysis_output/):

1. **curriculum_progression.png** - Shows agent stuck at stage 2
2. **training_losses.png** - Value loss increasing over time
3. **entropy.png** - Exploration maintained (good!)

## 🎓 References & Best Practices

See Section 10 of [COMPREHENSIVE_TRAINING_ANALYSIS.md](COMPREHENSIVE_TRAINING_ANALYSIS.md) for:
- PPO paper (Schulman et al. 2017)
- Curriculum learning theory
- Reward shaping (Ng et al. 1999)
- OpenAI Spinning Up guides
- Stable-Baselines3 best practices

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Don't skip the reward scaling fix** - This is the most critical issue
2. **Test before full training** - Run 100k steps to validate fixes work
3. **Monitor value estimates** - Should stay in [-5, 5] range
4. **Enable VecNormalize** - Critical for value function stability
