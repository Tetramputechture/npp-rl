## What Was Done

### 1. Comprehensive Reward System Review

**Analyzed:**
- ✅ Reward propagation through training pipeline (architecture_trainer.py → env → callbacks → TensorBoard)
- ✅ PBRS implementation in pbrs_potentials.py and main_reward_calculator.py
- ✅ Reward constants and scales in reward_constants.py
- ✅ TensorBoard logging in EnhancedTensorBoardCallback
- ✅ Route visualization in RouteVisualizationCallback
- ✅ Environment info dict population in base_environment.py

**Validated Against:**
- ✅ OpenAI Spinning Up best practices
- ✅ Ng et al. (1999) PBRS theory
- ✅ PPO hyperparameter guidelines
- ✅ Modern RL debugging practices

### 2. Critical Issues Found and Fixed

#### Issue #1: PBRS Gamma Mismatch 🔴 CRITICAL

**Problem:**
```
PPO:  gamma = 0.999
PBRS: gamma = 0.99   ← MISMATCH!
```

**Impact:** Violates policy invariance guarantee from Ng et al. (1999)

**Fix:** Changed `PBRS_GAMMA` to 0.999 in `reward_constants.py`

**Repository:** nclone  
**Branch:** fix-pbrs-gamma-mismatch  
**PR:** https://github.com/Tetramputechture/nclone/pull/48

#### Issue #2: Missing Step-Level PBRS Logging 🟠 IMPORTANT

**Problem:** PBRS components only logged at episode end, no step-level tracking

**Impact:** Impossible to:
- Monitor PBRS contribution during training
- Debug reward shaping issues
- Analyze potential function behavior

**Fix:** Enhanced `EnhancedTensorBoardCallback` with:
- Step-level PBRS component tracking
- Potential function monitoring
- Contribution ratio analysis

**Repository:** npp-rl  
**Branch:** reward-system-review-and-fixes  
**PR:** https://github.com/Tetramputechture/npp-rl/pull/68

### 3. Documented Design Considerations

#### Time Penalty Accumulation ℹ️ INFO

**Observation:**
- 100-step episode: -1.0 penalty (equals success reward)
- 200-step episode: -2.0 penalty (exceeds success reward)

**Recommendation:** Monitor for long episodes, consider adaptive scaling if needed

**Status:** Documented in `REWARD_SYSTEM_FIXES.md`, not changed (design decision)

## New TensorBoard Metrics

### PBRS Reward Components
```
pbrs_rewards/
  ├── navigation_mean         # Dense navigation reward
  ├── navigation_std
  ├── exploration_mean        # New area exploration
  ├── exploration_std
  ├── pbrs_mean              # F(s,s') = γ·Φ(s') - Φ(s)
  ├── pbrs_std
  ├── pbrs_min               # Debugging (should be ~-0.05)
  ├── pbrs_max               # Debugging (should be ~+0.05)
  ├── total_mean             # Base + PBRS + exploration
  └── total_std
```

### PBRS Potentials
```
pbrs_potentials/
  ├── objective_mean          # Distance to switch/exit
  ├── objective_std
  ├── hazard_mean            # Proximity to mines
  ├── impact_mean            # Wall collision penalty
  └── exploration_mean       # Unvisited area potential
```

### PBRS Analysis
```
pbrs_summary/
  └── pbrs_contribution_ratio  # |PBRS| / |Total reward|
```

**Expected Values:**
- Early training: 20-30% contribution (high exploration)
- Mid training: 10-15% contribution (learning paths)
- Late training: 5-10% contribution (terminal rewards dominate)

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Verify PBRS Gamma Fix

```bash
cd /workspace/nclone
python -c "from nclone.gym_environment.reward_calculation.reward_constants import PBRS_GAMMA; print(f'PBRS Gamma: {PBRS_GAMMA}')"
# Expected output: PBRS Gamma: 0.999
```

### 2. Test Enhanced Logging

```bash
cd /workspace/npp-rl
python npp_rl/training/architecture_trainer.py --enable-pbrs
```

**Check TensorBoard:**
```bash
tensorboard --logdir runs/
```

**Verify Metrics Appear:**
- `pbrs_rewards/pbrs_mean` - Should show values in [-0.05, 0.05] range
- `pbrs_potentials/objective_mean` - Should increase as agent learns
- `pbrs_summary/pbrs_contribution_ratio` - Should be 10-20%

### 3. Monitor Time Penalty

**Track:** `episode/length_mean` vs `episode/reward_mean`

**Alert If:**
- Successful episodes have negative net rewards
- Strong negative correlation between length and reward

## Expected Learning Improvements

### From Gamma Fix

1. **More stable convergence** - No policy interference from mismatched PBRS
2. **Better final policy** - Policy invariance now guaranteed
3. **Consistent behavior** - PBRS provides gradient without distortion

**Measurement:**
- Compare learning curves before/after
- Check convergence stability (less oscillation)
- Verify same final policy with/without PBRS

### From Enhanced Logging

1. **Faster debugging** - Step-level component visibility
2. **Better hyperparameter tuning** - See exact PBRS contribution
3. **Early problem detection** - Catch reward domination issues

**Use Cases:**
- PBRS contribution > 50% → Reduce PBRS scales
- PBRS contribution < 5% → Increase PBRS scales
- Objective potential flat → Potential function not providing gradient
