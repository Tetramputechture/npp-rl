# Physics Integration Guidelines

## Always Use nclone Physics Constants

The N++ game simulation has well-defined physics constants in `nclone.constants`. **Always import and use these instead of defining your own versions.**

### Import Pattern
```python
from nclone.constants import (
    # Ninja physics
    NINJA_RADIUS,
    GRAVITY_FALL,
    GRAVITY_JUMP,
    MAX_HOR_SPEED,
    GROUND_ACCEL,
    AIR_ACCEL,
    
    # Jump mechanics
    JUMP_FLAT_GROUND_Y,
    JUMP_WALL_SLIDE_X,
    JUMP_WALL_SLIDE_Y,
    JUMP_WALL_REGULAR_X,
    JUMP_WALL_REGULAR_Y,
    
    # Collision and damage
    MAX_SURVIVABLE_IMPACT,
    MIN_SURVIVABLE_CRUSHING
)
```

### Movement State Integration

Use the established movement states from the physics system:

```python
# From npp_rl.models.trajectory_calculator
class MovementState(IntEnum):
    IMMOBILE = 0
    RUNNING = 1
    GROUND_SLIDING = 2
    JUMPING = 3
    FALLING = 4
    WALL_SLIDING = 5
    WALL_JUMPING = 6
    LAUNCH_PAD = 7
    AIRBORNE = 8
```

These correspond directly to the ninja's movement state in the simulation.

## Physics-Aware Calculations

### Trajectory Calculations

When calculating movement trajectories, use the actual physics constants:

```python
def calculate_jump_trajectory(self, src_pos, tgt_pos):
    """Calculate jump trajectory using N++ physics constants."""
    dx = tgt_pos[0] - src_pos[0]
    dy = tgt_pos[1] - src_pos[1]
    
    # Use actual gravity values from the game
    if dy < 0:  # Upward movement
        gravity = GRAVITY_JUMP  # Lower gravity while jumping
        initial_velocity_y = JUMP_FLAT_GROUND_Y
    else:  # Falling
        gravity = GRAVITY_FALL  # Higher gravity when falling
        initial_velocity_y = 0
    
    # Calculate using real physics
    time_of_flight = self._calculate_flight_time(dy, initial_velocity_y, gravity)
    horizontal_velocity = dx / time_of_flight if time_of_flight > 0 else 0
    
    return TrajectoryResult(
        feasible=abs(horizontal_velocity) <= MAX_HOR_SPEED,
        time_of_flight=time_of_flight,
        ...
    )
```

### Collision Detection

Use the ninja radius for spatial calculations:

```python
def check_wall_contact(self, ninja_pos, wall_segments):
    """Check if ninja is in contact with wall using actual ninja radius."""
    for segment in wall_segments:
        distance = self._point_to_segment_distance(ninja_pos, segment)
        if distance <= NINJA_RADIUS:
            return True
    return False
```

### Movement Energy Calculations

Base energy costs on actual movement mechanics:

```python
def calculate_movement_energy(self, movement_type, distance, velocity):
    """Calculate energy cost based on N++ movement mechanics."""
    if movement_type == MovementType.WALK:
        # Ground movement uses GROUND_ACCEL
        base_energy = distance * GROUND_ACCEL
    elif movement_type == MovementType.JUMP:
        # Jumping fights gravity
        base_energy = distance * GRAVITY_JUMP * 10  # Scale appropriately
    elif movement_type == MovementType.WALL_SLIDE:
        # Wall sliding has friction
        base_energy = distance * 0.5  # Lower energy due to gravity assist
    
    # Factor in velocity limits
    if velocity > MAX_HOR_SPEED:
        base_energy *= 2  # Penalty for exceeding speed limits
    
    return base_energy
```

## Integration with Game State

### Ninja State Processing

When processing ninja state information, use the actual state values:

```python
def classify_movement_from_state(self, ninja_state, target_pos):
    """Classify movement based on current ninja state."""
    current_movement = ninja_state.movement_state
    
    # Use actual movement state values
    if current_movement == MovementState.WALL_SLIDING:
        return self._classify_wall_movement(ninja_state, target_pos)
    elif current_movement == MovementState.JUMPING:
        return self._classify_jump_movement(ninja_state, target_pos)
    elif current_movement in [MovementState.RUNNING, MovementState.GROUND_SLIDING]:
        return self._classify_ground_movement(ninja_state, target_pos)
    else:
        return self._classify_generic_movement(ninja_state, target_pos)
```

### Velocity and Acceleration

Use proper velocity calculations:

```python
def calculate_required_velocity(self, src_pos, tgt_pos, movement_type):
    """Calculate velocity needed for movement using physics constants."""
    distance = np.linalg.norm(np.array(tgt_pos) - np.array(src_pos))
    
    if movement_type == MovementType.WALK:
        # Use ground acceleration to calculate time
        # v = sqrt(2 * a * d) for constant acceleration
        required_velocity = min(np.sqrt(2 * GROUND_ACCEL * distance), MAX_HOR_SPEED)
    elif movement_type == MovementType.JUMP:
        # Consider air acceleration and gravity
        horizontal_component = abs(tgt_pos[0] - src_pos[0])
        required_velocity = min(horizontal_component / self._estimate_jump_time(src_pos, tgt_pos), MAX_HOR_SPEED)
    
    return required_velocity
```

## Wall Jump Mechanics

Implement wall jump physics using the defined constants:

```python
def calculate_wall_jump_velocity(self, wall_normal):
    """Calculate wall jump velocity using N++ constants."""
    # N++ has specific wall jump velocities
    if abs(wall_normal[0]) > 0.7:  # Mostly vertical wall
        velocity_x = JUMP_WALL_REGULAR_X * np.sign(wall_normal[0])
        velocity_y = JUMP_WALL_REGULAR_Y
    else:  # Sloped wall or wall slide
        velocity_x = JUMP_WALL_SLIDE_X * np.sign(wall_normal[0])
        velocity_y = JUMP_WALL_SLIDE_Y
    
    return (velocity_x, velocity_y)
```

## Launch Pad Physics

Handle launch pad boost mechanics:

```python
def calculate_launch_pad_boost(self, ninja_velocity, launch_pad_direction):
    """Calculate launch pad boost using N++ physics."""
    # Apply launch pad boost factor
    boost_scalar = JUMP_LAUNCH_PAD_BOOST_SCALAR
    boost_factor = JUMP_LAUNCH_PAD_BOOST_FACTOR
    
    # Boost is applied in the launch pad direction
    boosted_velocity = (
        ninja_velocity[0] + launch_pad_direction[0] * boost_scalar * boost_factor,
        ninja_velocity[1] + launch_pad_direction[1] * boost_scalar * boost_factor
    )
    
    # Still respect speed limits
    speed = np.linalg.norm(boosted_velocity)
    if speed > MAX_HOR_SPEED * 2:  # Launch pads can exceed normal speed
        boosted_velocity = tuple(v * (MAX_HOR_SPEED * 2) / speed for v in boosted_velocity)
    
    return boosted_velocity
```

## Validation Against Simulation

### Cross-Reference with nclone

When implementing physics calculations, validate against the actual simulation:

```python
def validate_physics_calculation(self, calculated_result, simulation_result):
    """Validate our physics calculations against nclone simulation."""
    # Allow for small numerical differences
    position_tolerance = NINJA_RADIUS * 0.1
    velocity_tolerance = 0.1
    
    pos_diff = np.linalg.norm(calculated_result.final_pos - simulation_result.final_pos)
    vel_diff = np.linalg.norm(calculated_result.final_vel - simulation_result.final_vel)
    
    if pos_diff > position_tolerance:
        print(f"Position calculation differs from simulation: {pos_diff}")
    if vel_diff > velocity_tolerance:
        print(f"Velocity calculation differs from simulation: {vel_diff}")
    
    return pos_diff <= position_tolerance and vel_diff <= velocity_tolerance
```

## Documentation of Physics Assumptions

Always document the physics assumptions and limitations:

```python
def calculate_trajectory_simple(self, src_pos, tgt_pos):
    """
    Calculate simplified trajectory for movement planning.
    
    Physics assumptions:
    - Uses GRAVITY_FALL for all falling motion
    - Uses GRAVITY_JUMP for upward motion phases
    - Ignores air resistance and complex collision shapes
    - Assumes flat ground for walking calculations
    - Does not account for tile-specific physics (slopes, bounce blocks)
    
    For precise trajectory prediction, use the full nclone simulation.
    """
```

## Constants Module Organization

If you need additional physics-derived constants, create them in a separate module and clearly document their derivation:

```python
# npp_rl/physics/derived_constants.py
"""
Physics constants derived from nclone base constants.
These are calculated values, not redefinitions of existing constants.
"""

from nclone.constants import GRAVITY_FALL, JUMP_FLAT_GROUND_Y, MAX_HOR_SPEED

# Derived time constants for common movements
TYPICAL_JUMP_TIME = abs(2 * JUMP_FLAT_GROUND_Y / GRAVITY_FALL)
MAX_HORIZONTAL_DISTANCE_PER_JUMP = MAX_HOR_SPEED * TYPICAL_JUMP_TIME

# Movement difficulty scaling factors (our additions to the physics)
DIFFICULTY_SCALE_JUMP = 1.5
DIFFICULTY_SCALE_WALL_JUMP = 2.0
DIFFICULTY_SCALE_LAUNCH_PAD = 0.4
```

## Testing Physics Integration

Test your physics calculations against known game behaviors:

```python
def test_physics_constants_match_game_behavior(self):
    """Test that our physics calculations match expected game behavior."""
    # Test basic jump
    jump_time = self._calculate_jump_duration(JUMP_FLAT_GROUND_Y, GRAVITY_FALL)
    
    # Should match known game behavior (approximately 30 frames at 60fps)
    expected_time = 30 / 60  # 0.5 seconds
    self.assertAlmostEqual(jump_time, expected_time, places=1)
    
    # Test maximum horizontal speed
    max_distance_per_frame = MAX_HOR_SPEED
    self.assertLess(max_distance_per_frame, 5.0)  # Reasonable pixel distance
```
