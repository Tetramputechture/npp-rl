## Executive Summary

### The Problem
Your RL agent demonstrates **learning capability** (78.3% success on simplest levels) but **fails to generalize** (0% test success). The training run of 1M timesteps shows clear signs of learning but in the wrong direction - the agent learned to survive, not to complete levels efficiently.

### Root Cause
**The reward structure is fundamentally misaligned with your objectives.**

Current reward design:
- Huge penalties for failure (death: -100, time: -0.1/frame)
- Rare rewards for success (completion: +1000)
- Result: Agent learns "don't die" and "wander safely"

This creates average episode rewards of **-40.26** (very negative), which signals to the agent that everything it does is bad.

### The Solution
Three critical fixes will transform performance:

1. **Fix Reward Structure** (2-3 days)
   - Reduce penalties by 10x
   - Add milestone rewards (switch touched: +0.5)
   - Normalize to [-1, +1] scale
   - Expected impact: Positive average rewards

2. **Debug PBRS** (1-2 days)  
   - Fix negative PBRS contribution (-0.0043 ‚Üí 0+)
   - Ensure potential functions are non-negative
   - Reduce PBRS dominance (99.4% ‚Üí 20-40%)

3. **Optimize Configuration** (1 day)
   - Remove frame stacking (4x speedup, no accuracy loss)
   - Increase environments 28‚Üí128 (better generalization)
   - Lower curriculum threshold 0.5‚Üí0.4 (enable progression)
   - Increase training budget 1M‚Üí5M+ timesteps

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
```python
# Test reward function
def test_reward_positive_on_completion():
    env = create_test_env()
    # ... complete level ...
    assert total_reward > 0

def test_pbrs_non_negative():
    calc = SubtaskRewardCalculator()
    # ... sample states ...
    assert pbrs_reward >= -0.001  # Allow tiny negatives

def test_curriculum_advances():
    manager = CurriculumManager(threshold=0.4)
    # ... achieve 45% success ...
    assert manager.should_advance()
```

**Integration Tests:**
- Full episode with new rewards
- Curriculum progression over 100K steps
- Memory usage with 128 envs
- Training stability over 1M steps

**Validation Runs:**
- 100K steps: Verify no crashes
- 500K steps: Check reward trend
- 1M steps: Verify curriculum advancing
- 2M steps: Full evaluation

### Monitoring Checklist

**Every 500K steps:**
- [ ] Check average reward (positive?)
- [ ] Check success rates (improving?)
- [ ] Check curriculum stage (advancing?)
- [ ] Check NOOP percentage (decreasing?)
- [ ] Check PBRS contribution (reasonable?)
- [ ] Check clip fraction (stable?)
- [ ] Review failure cases (patterns?)
- [ ] Generate route visualizations
- [ ] Save checkpoint

**Alerts to Set:**
- ‚ùå Average reward still negative after 1M steps
- ‚ùå Success rate declining over 500K steps

## Conclusion

Your NPP-RL training infrastructure is **solid and well-designed**. The simulation is accurate, the observations are rich, the PPO implementation is standard, and the curriculum system is in place. The agent is **demonstrably learning** (78% success on easy levels proves this).

**The core issue is reward engineering** - a common and solvable problem in RL.

With the recommended fixes, particularly the reward structure changes, I expect:
- **Immediate improvement** (positive rewards within 500K steps)
- **Steady progress** (curriculum advancing through stages)
- **Good generalization** (>50% test success within 10M steps)

The analysis in this PR provides:
