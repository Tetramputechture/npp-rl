"""GPU observation wrapper using pinned memory for faster transfers.

This wrapper uses CUDA pinned (page-locked) memory for observation buffers,
enabling faster async CPU→GPU transfers during batch processing. Observations
remain as numpy arrays for compatibility with stable-baselines3 wrappers.

Key features:
- Uses pinned memory for faster CPU→GPU transfers
- Pre-allocates buffers to avoid repeated allocations
- Returns numpy arrays for compatibility with VecTransposeImage
- Falls back to CPU if GPU unavailable
