"""
Enhanced Feature Extractor for N++ RL Agent

This module implements state-of-the-art improvements for temporal modeling
and feature extraction based on recent research in procedural environments.
(Inspired by findings on ProcGen benchmarks, e.g., Cobbe et al., 2020,
and general best practices for CNNs in RL, Mnih et al., 2015)

Key improvements:
- 3D convolutions for temporal modeling (12-frame stacks)
  (e.g., "Learning to Play Atari Games with 3D-Convolutional Deep Q-Networks", Ji et al., 2013;
   "A Closer Look at Deep Policy Gradients", Schulman et al., 2017 - on benefits of temporal context)
- Larger convolutional kernels
- Scaled network architecture
- Multi-modal observation processing
