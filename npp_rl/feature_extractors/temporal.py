"""
Temporal Feature Extractor for N++ RL Agent

This module implements the enhanced temporal feature extractor with 3D convolutions
for modeling temporal dynamics in frame-stacked observations.

Key features:
- 3D convolutions for temporal modeling (12-frame stacks)
- Larger convolutional kernels for better feature extraction
- Scaled network architecture
- Multi-modal observation processing (visual + symbolic)

Based on research findings showing 37.9% reduction in optimality gap with
temporal modeling improvements.

    Enhanced feature extractor using 3D convolutions for temporal modeling.
    
    This extractor processes temporal sequences of visual observations alongside
    symbolic game state information. It uses 3D convolutions to capture temporal
    dependencies in frame-stacked observations.
    
    Key improvements over standard CNNs:
    - Frame stacking (12 frames) with 3D convolutions
    - Larger convolutional kernels for better spatial feature extraction
    - Scaled network architecture with batch normalization and dropout
    - Adaptive pooling for handling variable input sizes
