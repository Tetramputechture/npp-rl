"""
Production-Ready HGT Multimodal Feature Extractor for NPP-RL.

This module provides a comprehensive multimodal feature extractor that combines:
1. Advanced temporal processing via 3D CNN for frame stacks (12 frames)
2. Spatial processing via 2D CNN with attention for global view
3. Full Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) for graph reasoning
4. Advanced cross-modal fusion with attention mechanisms

Key Design Principles:
- 3D CNN captures temporal movement patterns essential for NPP gameplay
- 2D CNN with spatial attention processes global level understanding
- Full HGT with type-specific attention handles entity relationships
- Cross-modal fusion optimally integrates all modalities
- Designed for generalizability across diverse NPP level configurations

Architecture Rationale:
- 3D CNNs excel at temporal video processing (proven in action recognition)
- HGT with heterogeneous attention handles diverse node/edge types effectively
- Cross-modal attention enables optimal multimodal feature integration
- Spatial attention focuses on relevant level regions for decision making

    Production-ready HGT-based multimodal feature extractor for NPP-RL.

    This extractor combines advanced neural architectures for optimal performance:
    
    1. **Temporal Processing (3D CNN)**: Processes 12-frame temporal stacks to capture
       movement patterns and temporal dynamics essential for NPP gameplay. Uses 3D
       convolutions with batch normalization and dropout for robust training.
       
    2. **Spatial Processing (2D CNN + Attention)**: Processes global level view with
       integrated spatial attention mechanisms for enhanced spatial reasoning and
       level structure understanding.
       
    3. **Graph Processing (Full HGT)**: Complete Heterogeneous Graph Transformer
       implementation with type-specific attention for different node types (tiles,
       entities, hazards) and edge types (adjacent, reachable, functional).
       
    4. **Cross-Modal Fusion**: Advanced attention mechanisms for optimal multimodal
       integration with layer normalization and residual connections.

    Architecture Design Rationale:
    - 3D CNNs proven superior for temporal video processing in action recognition
    - HGT handles heterogeneous graph structures better than standard GNNs
    - Cross-modal attention enables optimal feature integration across modalities
    - Spatial attention focuses processing on relevant level regions
    - Designed for generalizability across diverse NPP level configurations
