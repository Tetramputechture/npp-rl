Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM) with Reachability Integration

This module enhances the existing Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM) with reachability-aware
exploration that avoids wasting curiosity on unreachable areas, improving sample efficiency.

Integration Strategy:
- Reachability scaling modulates base curiosity based on accessibility analysis
- Frontier detection boosts exploration of newly reachable areas from nclone physics
- Strategic weighting prioritizes exploration near level completion objectives
- Performance-optimized for real-time RL training (<1ms curiosity computation)

Theoretical Foundation:
- Base ICM: Pathak et al. (2017) "Curiosity-driven Exploration by Self-supervised Prediction"  
- Reachability guidance: Ecoffet et al. (2019) "Go-Explore: a New Approach for Hard-Exploration Problems"
- Strategic exploration: Burda et al. (2018) "Exploration by Random Network Distillation"
- Frontier exploration: Stanton & Clune (2018) "Deep curiosity search"

nclone Integration:
- Uses compact reachability features from nclone.graph.reachability for accessibility assessment
- Integrates with TieredReachabilitySystem for performance-optimized reachability queries
- Maintains compatibility with existing NPP physics constants and level objectives
