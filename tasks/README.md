4. **GPU Resources**: Verify GPU access for RL training and testing
5. **Data Access**: Ensure access to replay datasets and test data

### Execution Order
The tasks have clear dependencies and should be executed in order:

1. **TASK_001** (Replay Processing) - Foundation for learning from demonstrations
2. **TASK_002** (Reachability Integration) - Requires enhanced reachability from nclone
3. **TASK_003** (Hierarchical RL) - Builds on reachability integration

### Quality Standards
Each task must meet the following standards:
- **Functional Requirements**: All specified functionality implemented and tested
