# Critical Bug Fixes - Summary

This document summarizes two critical bugs fixed in this branch.

## Fix #1: Curriculum Learning Subprocess Synchronization

**Location:** `npp-rl/npp_rl/wrappers/curriculum_env.py`

### Problem
When using `SubprocVecEnv` (vectorized environments with >4 workers), curriculum stage changes were not propagated to subprocess environments. Each subprocess maintained its own copy of the `CurriculumManager`, and when the main process advanced to a harder stage, the subprocesses never learned about it—they continued sampling from the starting stage indefinitely.

### Impact
- Curriculum learning appeared to work (logs showed advancement)
- But training was completely non-functional—all environments stayed on easy levels
- Agent never experienced harder levels, defeating the purpose of curriculum learning

### Solution
Added subprocess synchronization mechanism:
1. `CurriculumEnv.set_curriculum_stage(stage)` - Updates subprocess curriculum stage
2. `CurriculumVecEnvWrapper._sync_curriculum_stage(stage)` - Syncs to all subprocesses using `VecEnv.env_method()`
3. Automatic sync on initialization and after each advancement

### Files Changed
- `npp_rl/wrappers/curriculum_env.py` (+52 lines, -5 lines)
- `npp_rl/evaluation/test_suite_loader.py` (+1 line, -1 line, cosmetic category order fix)

## Fix #2: Consistent Frame Stack Augmentation

**Location:** `nclone/nclone/gym_environment/` (multiple files)

### Problem
When visual augmentation was enabled with frame stacking, each frame in the stack received a DIFFERENT random augmentation:
- Frame 1 (t-3): rotated 5° left, brightness +10%, cropped at position A
- Frame 2 (t-2): rotated 3° right, brightness -5%, cropped at position B  
- Frame 3 (t-1): no rotation, brightness +15%, cropped at position C
- Frame 4 (t): rotated 2° left, brightness +8%, cropped at position D

This broke temporal coherence—frames in the same stack had inconsistent transformations, making it impossible for the agent to learn motion and velocity from frame differences.

### Impact
- Visual augmentation broke temporal information in frame stacks
- Agent couldn't properly learn from frame history
- Motion/velocity cues were corrupted by inconsistent transforms
- Training likely degraded when using both augmentation + frame stacking

### Solution
Moved augmentation from `ObservationProcessor` to `FrameStackWrapper`:
1. Added `return_replay` parameter to `apply_augmentation()` to capture transform parameters
2. Added `apply_augmentation_with_replay()` to replay the same transform on multiple frames
3. Modified `FrameStackWrapper.observation()` to apply the SAME augmentation to all frames in a stack
4. Used albumentations' `ReplayCompose` to record and replay exact transformations

Now all frames in a stack receive identical augmentation, preserving temporal coherence.

### Files Changed
- `nclone/nclone/gym_environment/frame_augmentation.py` (+45 lines, -13 lines)
- `nclone/nclone/gym_environment/frame_stack_wrapper.py` (+140 lines, -25 lines)
- `nclone/nclone/gym_environment/observation_processor.py` (+3 lines, -10 lines)
- `nclone/test_consistent_augmentation.py` (+117 lines, new file - test script)

## How to Use These Fixes

### Curriculum Learning (Fix #1)
No code changes needed. The fix is automatic—just use curriculum learning as before:

```python
python scripts/train_and_compare.py \
    --num-envs 8 \
    --total-timesteps 500000 \
    --use-curriculum \
    --log-level INFO
```

Look for these log messages to confirm it's working:
- `"Syncing initial curriculum stage 'very_simple' to all environments"` (on startup)
- `"Curriculum advanced to: simple"` (after advancement)
- `"Synced curriculum stage 'simple' to all 8 environments"` (after advancement)

### Frame Stack Augmentation (Fix #2)
When creating environments with frame stacking + augmentation, pass augmentation config to `FrameStackWrapper` instead of `ObservationProcessor`:

**Before (broken):**
```python
env = NPlusPlusEnv(...)
env.observation_processor = ObservationProcessor(enable_augmentation=True)
env = FrameStackWrapper(env, visual_stack_size=4)
```

**After (fixed):**
```python
env = NPlusPlusEnv(...)
env.observation_processor = ObservationProcessor(enable_augmentation=False)  # Disable here
env = FrameStackWrapper(
    env,
    visual_stack_size=4,
    enable_augmentation=True,  # Enable here instead
    augmentation_config={"p": 0.5, "intensity": "medium", "disable_validation": True}
)
```

## Testing

### Curriculum Learning Test
```bash
cd /workspace/npp-rl
python scripts/train_and_compare.py \
    --num-envs 8 \
    --total-timesteps 50000 \
    --use-curriculum \
    --log-level INFO
```

### Frame Augmentation Test
```bash
cd /workspace/nclone
python test_consistent_augmentation.py
```

Expected output: "ALL TESTS PASSED!"

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Both fixes are committed and ready for use
2. ✅ Test training runs to verify fixes work in practice
3. ✅ Update any training configs that use both augmentation + frame stacking
4. ✅ Monitor curriculum progression in training logs

### Training Best Practices
1. **Always use curriculum learning with >4 environments** - The fix ensures it works correctly now
2. **Enable augmentation in FrameStackWrapper, not ObservationProcessor** - Ensures consistent transforms
3. **Monitor curriculum stage in logs** - Verify stages advance as expected
4. **Use frame stacking for temporal information** - Now works correctly with augmentation

## Technical Details

### Why Subprocess Sync Matters
`SubprocVecEnv` creates separate Python processes for each environment. When an object is passed to a subprocess, it's pickled (serialized) and sent. Each subprocess gets its own COPY, not a reference. Changes in the main process don't affect subprocess copies unless explicitly synchronized.

### Why Consistent Augmentation Matters
Frame stacking provides temporal information by showing the agent multiple consecutive frames. If each frame has different augmentation:
- Brightness changes look like lighting changes (confuses the agent)
- Crops/shifts look like camera movement (fake motion)
- Rotations break spatial relationships (makes navigation harder)

Consistent augmentation means frames are transformed together—they still show real motion/velocity while adding visual diversity for generalization.

## Questions?

### Q: Will these fixes break existing code?
**A:** No. Both fixes are backward compatible and additive. Existing code continues to work.

### Q: Do I need to retrain models?
**A:** Only if you were using:
1. Curriculum learning with >4 environments (wasn't working before)
2. Frame stacking + augmentation together (was broken before)

### Q: How do I verify the fixes work?
**A:** 
1. Curriculum: Check logs for "Synced curriculum stage" messages
2. Augmentation: Run `test_consistent_augmentation.py`

### Q: What if I don't use these features?
**A:** The fixes don't affect you. No action needed.
