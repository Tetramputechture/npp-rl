## Constructing an Observation Space from N++ for Reinforcement Learning

This document outlines a strategy for extracting an observation space from the N++ executable for use in reinforcement learning. We'll explore two primary approaches:

**1. Memory Reading and Injection (Less Invasive):**

This method avoids modifying the game's executable, making it simpler and less prone to breaking updates.

* **Tools:**  Cheat Engine, Python `pymem`, `numpy`
* **Process:**
    1. **Identify Memory Addresses:** Use Cheat Engine to locate the memory addresses holding relevant game state information. This includes player position (x, y), velocity (x, y), gold collected, time remaining, and information about nearby obstacles and enemies.  Focus on dynamic values that change during gameplay.  Cheat Engine's "scan type" options (e.g., "Float," "Integer," "Byte") and "value type" (e.g., "Changed," "Unchanged," "Increased," "Decreased") will be crucial for narrowing down the search.
    2. **Python Interface:** Utilize the `pymem` library in Python to read these memory addresses in real-time.  `pymem` allows attaching to a running process and reading/writing memory.
    3. **Observation Space Construction:**  Create a NumPy array or a custom Python class to represent the observation space. Populate this space with the values read from memory.  The structure of this space is crucial for RL performance. Consider:
        * **Direct Values:** Player position, velocity, gold, time.
        * **Grid Representation:** Discretize the game area into a grid and represent obstacles, enemies, and the player's position within this grid. This provides a more structured representation for convolutional neural networks.
        * **Distance to Objects:** Calculate distances to the nearest obstacles, enemies, and the goal.
    4. **Synchronization:** Ensure proper synchronization between reading memory and the game's frame rate.  You might need to experiment with timing to avoid reading inconsistent data.

**Example (Python with pymem):**

```python
import pymem
import numpy as np

pm = pymem.Pymem("N++.exe")  # Replace with the actual executable name

# Addresses (replace with actual addresses found using Cheat Engine)
player_x_addr = 0x...
player_y_addr = 0x...
# ... other addresses

def get_observation():
    player_x = pm.read_float(player_x_addr)
    player_y = pm.read_float(player_y_addr)
    # ... read other values

    observation = np.array([player_x, player_y, ...]) # Construct the observation array
    return observation

# In your RL loop:
observation = get_observation()
# ... use observation in your RL algorithm
```


**2. Decompilation and Hooking (More Invasive):**

This method offers more control and potentially access to internal game logic, but requires more advanced reverse engineering skills.

* **Tools:**  IDA Pro, Ghidra, a C++ debugger, Python `ctypes` or a custom DLL.
* **Process:**
    1. **Disassembly:** Disassemble the N++ executable using IDA Pro or Ghidra. Identify the functions responsible for updating game state and rendering.
    2. **Hooking:** Inject a custom DLL or use code injection techniques to intercept calls to these functions.  Within the hook, read the relevant game state variables.
    3. **Data Transfer:**  Several options exist for transferring the observation data to Python:
        * **Shared Memory:** Create a shared memory region that both the game and the Python script can access.
        * **Pipes:** Use named pipes for inter-process communication.
        * **File I/O:**  Write the observation data to a file that the Python script reads. (Less efficient).
    4. **Observation Space Construction:** Similar to the memory reading approach, construct the observation space in Python using the received data.

**Advantages and Disadvantages:**

| Method | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|---|---|---|
| Memory Reading | Easier to implement, less invasive, less likely to break with game updates | Limited to accessible memory, potential synchronization issues |
| Decompilation and Hooking | More control, access to internal game logic, potentially more efficient | More complex, requires advanced reverse engineering skills, more likely to break with game updates |


**Key Considerations:**

* **Game Updates:**  Game updates can change memory addresses and code, breaking your observation extraction.  The memory reading approach is generally more robust to updates.
* **Performance:**  Minimize the overhead of reading and processing the observation data to avoid impacting game performance.
* **Observation Space Design:**  Careful design of the observation space is crucial for RL performance. Experiment with different representations to find what works best for your specific RL algorithm.
* **Anti-Cheat:**  Be mindful of anti-cheat mechanisms in online games.  Hooking and memory manipulation can trigger anti-cheat systems.


This detailed strategy provides a solid foundation for building an observation space from the N++ executable.  The choice between memory reading and decompilation/hooking depends on your technical skills and the level of control you require. Remember to prioritize ethical considerations and avoid using these techniques for cheating in online games.
