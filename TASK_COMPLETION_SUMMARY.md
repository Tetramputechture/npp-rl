- **Core Module Validation**: ✅ All imports successful
- **Training Scripts**: ✅ Operational with proper CLI
- **Documentation**: ✅ Updated with BC pretraining guide
- **Version Control**: ✅ Branches pushed to both repos

## Implementation Details

### 1. Hierarchical Policy Context Extraction ✅
**Location**: `npp-rl/npp_rl/models/hierarchical_policy.py:232-273`

**Implemented**: `_extract_subtask_context(observations, subtask)` method

**Features**:
- Extracts target positions from `reachability_features` based on current subtask
  - REACH_SWITCH: Uses index 1 (dist_to_switch)
  - REACH_EXIT: Uses index 2 (dist_to_exit)
  - EXPLORE: Uses connectivity metrics
- Computes distances using normalized reachability array
- Extracts mine proximity from hazard count (index 4)
- Estimates target coordinates from ninja position (game_state[0:2]) and distances
- Tracks time spent on subtask normalized by expected duration

**Impact**: Enables hierarchical policy to make informed decisions based on real game state

---

### 2. Switch Progress & Exit Accessibility ✅
**Location**: `nclone/nclone/nplay_headless.py:506-516`

**Implemented**:
```python
"switch_progress": 1.0 if self.exit_switch_activated() else -1.0
"exit_accessibility": 1.0 if self.exit_switch_activated() else -1.0
```

**Features**:
- Uses existing `exit_switch_activated()` game state method
- Provides clear training signals (-1/+1 values for neural network)
- Accurately reflects switch activation and exit accessibility state

**Impact**: Agents can properly track switch activation progress and exit availability

---

### 3. Reachability Features in Replay Executor ✅
**Location**: `nclone/nclone/replay/replay_executor.py:229-298`

**Implemented**: `_compute_reachability_features(ninja_x, ninja_y)` method

**8-Dimensional Output**:
```
[0] area_explored_ratio    - Visible area / total level area
[1] dist_to_switch         - Normalized distance to nearest switch
[2] dist_to_exit           - Normalized distance to exit door
[3] reachable_switches     - Count of accessible switches
[4] reachable_hazards      - Count of nearby mines/hazards
[5] connectivity           - Overall level connectivity metric
[6] exit_reachable         - Boolean: is exit currently accessible
[7] path_exists            - Boolean: path to objective exists
```

**Features**:
- Simplified approach suitable for replay ingestion context
- Computes features from game state without full graph analysis
- Provides meaningful spatial and accessibility information

**Impact**: Replay-based training and BC pretraining can utilize reachability information

---

### 4. Enhanced Reachability Fallback ✅
**Location**: `nclone/nclone/gym_environment/mixins/hierarchical_mixin.py:85-125`

**Implemented**: Multi-level fallback mechanism

**Fallback Hierarchy**:
1. **Primary**: Full reachability analysis with graph construction
2. **Secondary**: Distance-based computation from game state
   - Extracts ninja position, switch positions, exit position
   - Computes distances to closest switch and exit
   - Identifies mine proximity using entity states
   - Provides minimum viable reachability info
3. **Tertiary**: Zero-filled features with error logging

**Features**:
- Robust error handling prevents training crashes
- Maintains training continuity even when full system unavailable
- Proper error logging for debugging

**Impact**: System remains operational under all conditions, improves reliability

---

### 5. Test Suite Compatibility Fixes ✅
**Location**: `npp-rl/tests/training/test_pretraining_pipeline.py`

**Fixed Issues**:
- Updated `ArchitectureConfig` assertions to use nested structure
- Fixed `test_get_checkpoint_path()` to match actual method signature
- Corrected attribute access patterns (`features_dim`, `modalities.use_graph`)

**Results**: All 15 pretraining pipeline tests passing (100%)

**Impact**: Validates pretraining pipeline correctness, ensures future development safety
